Your 4 lines (top to bottom):

Broken line (2 segments) = 1 (Yin)
Broken line (2 segments) = 1 (Yin)
Dashed line (3 segments) = 2 (Old Yin/changing)
Solid line = 0 (Yang)

Convert from base-3 to decimal:
Position 1 (top): 1 × 3³ = 1 × 27 = 27
Position 2: 1 × 3² = 1 × 9 = 9
Position 3: 2 × 3¹ = 2 × 3 = 6
Position 4 (bottom): 0 × 3⁰ = 0 × 1 = 0

Total: 27 + 9 + 6 + 0 = 42
Add 1 for verse numbering (0-80 maps to 1-81): 42 + 1 = Verse 43
That's the calculation. 
It's normal base-3 conversion—each position represents a power of 3, 
   you multiply the digit (0, 1, or 2) by that power, then add them all up.

In the tracker code:
Solid line (Yang) = 0
Broken line (Yin) = 1
Dashed line (Old Yin/changing) = 2

However, in traditional I Ching:
Yang is often represented as 3 (solid line, unbroken)
Yin is often represented as 2 (broken line)
Old Yang (changing) is 9
Old Yin (changing) is 6

The tracker uses 0, 1, 2 because it's simpler for base-3 calculation and maps evenly to the 81 verses.
