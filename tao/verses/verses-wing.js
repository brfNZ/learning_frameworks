    "37": "The Tao never acts,\nAnd yet is never inactive.\n\nIf leaders can hold on to it,\nAll Things will be naturally influenced.\nInfluenced and yet desiring to act,\nI would calm them with Nameless Simplicity.\nNameless Simplicity is likewise without desire;\nAnd without desire there is harmony.\n\nThe world will then be naturally stabilized.",
    "38": "Superior Power is never Powerful, thus it has Power.\nInferior Power is always Powerful, thus it has no Power.\nSuperior Power takes no action and acts withotu motive.\nInferior Power takes action and acts with motive.\n\nSuperior philanthropy takes action and acts without motive.\nSuperior morality takes action and acts with motive.\nSuperior propriety takes action and there is no response;\nSo it raises its arm to project itself.\n\nTherefore, lose the Tao and Power follows.\nLose the Power and philanthropy follows.\nLose philanthropy and morality follows.\nLose morality and propriety follows.\n\nOne who has propriety has the veneer of truth\nAnd yet is the leader of confusion.\nOne who knows the future has the luster of the Tao\nAnd yet is ignorant of its origins.\n\nTherefore those wiht the greatest endurance\nCan enter the substantial,\nNot occupy its veneer;\nCan enter reality,\nNot occupy its luster.\nHence they discard one and receive the other.",

    "62": "The Tao is a refuge for All Things,\nThe treasure of the good,\nThe protector of the not good.\n\nHonor can be bought with fine words;\nOthers can be joined with fine conduct.\nSo if some are not good,\nWhy waste them?\n\nIn this way the Emperor is established;\nThe three officials are installed.\nAnd although the large jade disc\nIs preceded by a team of horses,\nThis is not as good as sitting,\nAdvancing in the Tao.\n\nWhy did those of old treasure the Tao?\nDid they not say:\nSeek it and it is attained;\nPosses faults and they are released?\nThus it is the treasure of the world.",
    "63": "Act without action; work without effort.\nTaste without savoring.\nMagnify the small; increase the few.\nRepay ill-will with kindness.\n\nPlan the difficult when it is easy;\nHandle the big where it is small.\nThe world's hardest work begins when it is easy;\nThe world's largest effort begins where it is small.\nEvolved Individuals, finally, take no great action,\nAnd in that way the great is achieved.\n\nThose who commit easily, inspire little trust,\nHow easy to inspire hardness!\nTherefore Evolved Individuals view all as difficult.\nFinally they have no difficulty!",
    "64": "What is at rest is easy to hold;\nWhat is not yet begun is easy to plan.\nWhat is thin is easy to melt;\nWhat is minute is easy to disperse.\nDeal with things before they emerge;\nPut them in order before there is disorder.\n\nA tree of many arm spans is produced from a tiny sprout.\nA tower of nine stories is raised from a pile of earth.\nA journey of a thousand miles begin with a footstep.\n\nThose who act on things, spoil them;\nThose who seize things, lose them.\nThus Evolved Individuals do nothing;\nHence they spoil nothing.\nThey seize nothing;\nHence they lose nothing.\n\nPeople often spoil their work at the point of its completion.\nWith care at the end as well as the beginning,\nNo work will be spoiled.\n\nThus Evolved Individuals desire to be desireless\nAnd do not treasure goods that are hard to get.\nThey learn without learning,\nBy returning to the place where the Collective Mind passes.\nIn this way they assist All Things naturally\nWithout venturing to act.",
    "65": "Those skillful in the ancient Tao\nAre not obvious to the people.\nThey appear to be simple-minded.\n\nPeople are difficult to lead\nBecause they are too clever.\nHence, to lead the organization with cleverness\nWill harm the organization.\nTo lead the organization without cleverness\nWill benefit the organization.\n\nThose who know these two things\nHave investigated the patterns of the Absolute.\nTo know and investigate the patterns\nIs called the Subtle Power.\n\nThe Subtle Power is profound and far-reaching.\nTogether wtih the Natural Law of polarity,\nIt leads to the Great Harmony.",
    "66": "The rivers and seas lead the hundred streams\nBecause they are skillful at staying low.\nThus they are able to lead the hundren streams.\n\nTherefore, to rise above people,\nOne must, in speaking, stay below them.\nTo remain in front of people,\nOne must put onself behind them.\n\nTherefore Evolved Individuals remain above,\nAnd yet the people are not weighted down.\nThey remain in front,\nAnd the people are not held back.\n\nTherefore the world willingly elects them,\nAnd yet it does not reject them.\nBecause they do not compete,\nThe world cannot compete with them.",
    "67": "All the world thinks that my Tao is great;\nAnd yet it seems inconceivable.\nOnly its greatness makes it seem inconceivable.\nIf it could be conceived of,\nIt would have become insignificant long ago.\n\nI have Three Treasures that support and protect;\nThe first is compassion.\nThe second is moderation.\nThe third is daring not to be first in the world.\n\nWith compassion one becomes courageous;\nWith moderation one becomes expansive.\nIn daring not to be first in the world,\nOne becomes the instrument of leadership.\n\nNow if one is courageous without compassion,\nOr expansive without moderation,\nOr first without holding back,\nOne is doomed!\n\nCompassion always triumphs when attacked;\nIt brings security when maintained.\nNature aids its leaders\nBy arming them with compassion.",
    "68": "A skillful leader does not use force.\nA skillful fighter does not feel anger.\nA skillful master does not engage the opponent.\nA skillful employer remains low.\n\nThis is called the power in not contending.\nThis is called the strength to employ others.\nThis is called the highest emulation of Nature.",
    "69": "The strategists have a saying:\n\"I dare not act as a host,\nYet I act as a guest,\nI dare not advance an inch,\nYet I retreat a foot.\"\n\nThis is called\nTraveling without moving,\nRising  without arms,\nProjecting without resistance,\nCapturing without strategies.\n\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating resistance;\nUnderestimating resistance will destroy my Treasures.\nThus when mutually opposing strategies escalate,\nThe one who feels sorrow will triumph.",
    "70": "Very easy to follow.\nYet the world is unable to know them,\nUnable to follow them.\n\nMy words have a source,\nMy efforts have mastery.\nIndeed, since none know this,\nThey do not know me.\nThe rare ones who know me\nMust treasure me.\n\nTherefore, Evolved Individuals\nWear a coarse cloth covering\nWith precious jade at the center.",
    "71": "To know that you do not know is best.\nTo not know of knowing is a disease.\n\nIndeed, to be sick of the disease,\nIs the way to be free of the disease.\n\nEvolved Individuals are free of the disease,\nBecause they are sick of the disease.\n\nThis is the way to be free of disease.",
    "72": "If the people do not fear authority,\nThen authority will expand.\nDo not disrespect their position;\nDo not reject their lives.\nSince indeed they are not rejected,\nThey do not reject.\n\nTherefore, enlightened people know themselves,\nBut do not display themselves.\nThey love themselves,\nBut do not treasure themselves.\n\nHence they discard one and receive the other.",
    "73": "Those bold in not daring will survive.\nOf these two, either may benefit or harm.\n\nNature decides which is evil,\nBut who can know why?\nEven Evolved Individuals regard this as difficult.\n\nThe Tao in Nature\nDoes not contend,\nYet skillfully triumphs.\nDoes not speak,\nYet skillfully responds.\nDoes not summon,\nAnd yet attracts.\nDoes not hasten,\nYet skillfully designs.\n\nNature's network is vast, so vast,\nIts mesh is coarse, yet nothing slips through.",
    "74": "When people do not fear death,\nHow can they be threatened with death?\nSuppose people fear death and still do not conform,\nWho would dare seize them and put them to death?\n\nThere is always the Master Executioner who kills.\nTo substitute for the Master Executioner in killing\nIs like substituting for the Master Carpenter who carves.\nWhoever substitutes for the Master Carpenter in carving,\nRarely escapes injury to his hands.",
    "75": "People are hungry.\nBecause those above consume too much in taxes,\nPeople are hungry.\n\nPeople are difficult to lead.\nBecause those above interfere with them,\nPeople are difficult to lead.\n\nPeople make light of death.\nBecause those above deeply seek survival,\nPeople make light of death.\n\nIndeed, it is those who do not interfere with life\nWho are capable of respecting life.",
    "76": "A man living is yielding and receptive.\nDying, he is rigid and inflexible.\nAll Things, the grass and trees:\nLiving, they are yielding and fragile;\nDying, they are dry and withered.\n\nThus those who are firm and inflexible\nAre in harmony with dying.\nThose who are yielding and receptive\nAre in harmony with living.\n\nTherefore an inflexible strategy will not triumph;\nAn inflexible tree will be attacked.\nThe position of the highly inflexible will descend;\nThe position of the yielding and receptive will ascend.",
    "77": "The Tao in Nature\nIs like a bow that is stretched.\nThe top is pulled down,\nThe bottom is raised .\nWhat is excessive is reduced,\nWhat is insufficient is supplemented.\n\nThe Tao in Nature\nReduces the excessive\nAnd supplements the insufficient.\nThe Tao in Man is not so;\nHe reduces the insufficient,\nBecause he serves the excessive.\n\nWho then can use excess to serve the world?\nThose who possess the Tao.\n\nTherefore Evolved Individuals\nAct without expectation,\nSucceed without taking credit,\nAnd have no desire to display their excellence.",
    "78": "Nothing in the world,\nIs as yielding and receptive as water;\nYet in attacking the firm and inflexible,\nNothing triumphs so well.\nBecause of what it is not,\nThis becomes easy.\n\nThe receptive triumphs over the inflexible;\nThe yielding triumphs over the rigid.\nNone in the world do not know this.\nNone have the ability to practice it.\n\nTherefore Evolved Individuals say:\nOne who accepts the disgrace of the organization\nCan be called the leader of the grain shrine.\nOne who accepts the misfortunes of the organization\nCan be called the leader of the world.\n\nRight words appear to reverse themselves.",
    "79": "Even when a great resentment is reconciled,\nSome resentment must linger,\nHow can this be made good?\n\nThat is why Evolved Individuals\nHold the left side of the contract\nAnd do not censure others.\nThose with Power are in charge of the contract;\nThose without Power are in charge of resolving it.\n\nThe Tao in Nature has no favorites.\nIt always works through the good person.",
    "80": "In a small organization with a few people;\n\nLet there be ten or a hundred times\nMore tools than they can use.\nLet the people value their lives\nAnd yet not move far away.\nEven though there are boats and carriages,\nThere is no occasion to use them.\nEven though there are armor and weapons,\nThere is no occasion to display them.\n\nLet the people again knot cords and use them.\nTheir food will be pleasing.\nTheir clothes will be fine.\nTheir homes will be secure.\nTheir customs will be joyful.\n\nNearby organizations may watch each other;\nTheir crowing and barking may be heard.\nYet the people may grow old and die\nWithout coming or going between them.",
    "81": "Embellished words are not sincere.\nThose who are good are not defensive;\nThose who are defensive are not good.\nThose who know are not erudite;\nThose who are erudite do not know.\n\nEvolved Individuals do not accumulate.\nThe more they do for others, the more they gain;\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess.\n\nThe Tao of Nature\nIs to serve without spoiling.\nThe Tao of Evolved Individuals\nIs to act wihtout contending.",
