    "Lau": {
        "1": "The way that can be spoken of\nIs not the constant way;\nThe name that can be named\nIs not the constant name.\nThe nameless was the beginning of heaven and earth;\nThe named was the mother of the myriad creatures.\nHence always rid yourself of desires in order to observe its secrets;\nBut always allow yourself to have desires in order to observe its manifestations.\nThese two are the same\nBut diverge in name as they issue forth.\nBeing the same they are called mysteries,\nMystery upon mystery -\nThe gateway of the manifold secrets.",
        "2": "The whole world recognizes the beautiful as the beautiful, yet this is only the ugly;\nthe whole world recognizes the good as the good, yet this is only the bad.\nThus Something and Nothing produce each other;\nThe difficult and the easy complement each other;\nThe long and the short off-set each other;\nThe high and the low incline towards each other;\nNote and sound harmonize with each other;\nBefore and after follow each other.\nTherefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practises the teaching that uses no words.\nThe myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority;\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt is because it lays claim to no merit\nThat its merit never deserts it.",
        "3": "Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention;\nnot to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft;\nnot to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind.\nTherefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones.\nHe always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and ensures that the clever never dare to act.\nDo that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail.",
        "4": "The way is empty, yet use will not drain it.\nDeep, it is like the ancestor of the myriad creatures.\nBlunt the sharpness;\nUntangle the knots;\nSoften the glare;\nLet your wheels move only along old ruts.\nDarkly visible, it only seems as if it were there.\nI know not whose son it is.\nIt images the forefather of God.",
        "5": "Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs;\nthe sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.\nIs not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?\nIt is empty without being exhausted:\nThe more it works the more comes out.\nMuch speech leads inevitably to silence.\nBetter to hold fast to the void.",
        "6": "The spirit of the valley never dies.\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female\nIs called the root of heaven and earth.\nDimly visible, it seems as if it were there,\nYet use will never drain it.",
        "7": "Heaven and earth are enduring.\nThe reason why heaven and earth can be enduring is that they do not give themselves life.\nHence they are able to be long-lived.\nTherefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first,\nTreats it as extraneous to himself and it is preserved.\nIs it not because he is without thought of self that he is able to accomplish his private ends?",
        "8": "Highest good is like water.\nBecause water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way.\nIn a home it is the site that matters;\nIn quality of mind it is depth that matters;\nIn an ally it is benevolence that matters;\nIn speech it is good faith that matters;\nIn government it is order that matters;\nIn affairs it is ability that matters;\nIn action it is timeliness that matters.\nIt is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.",
        "9": "Rather than fill it to the brim by keeping it upright\nBetter to have stopped in time;\nHammer it to a point\nAnd the sharpness cannot be preserved for ever;\nThere may be gold and jade to fill a hall\nBut there is none who can keep them.\nTo be overbearing when one has wealth and position\nIs to bring calamity upon oneself.\nTo retire when the task is accomplished\nIs the way of heaven.",
        "10": "When carrying on your head your perplexed bodily soul\nCan you embrace in your arms the One and not let go?\nIn concentrating your breath can you become as supple\nAs a babe?\nCan you polish your mysterious mirror\nAnd leave no blemish?\nCan you love the people and govern the state\nWithout resorting to action?\nWhen the gates of heaven open and shut\nAre you capable of keeping to the role of the female?\nWhen your discernment penetrates the four quarters\nAre you capable of not knowing anything?\nIt gives them life and rears them.\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue.",
        "11": "Thirty spokes share one hub.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the cart.\nKnead clay in order to make a vessel.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel.\nCut out doors and windows in order to make a room.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the room.\nThus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.",
        "12": "The five colors make man's eyes blind;\nThe five notes make his ears deaf;\nThe five tastes injure his palate;\nRiding and hunting\nMake his mind go wild with excitement;\nGoods hard to come by\nServe to hinder his progress.\nHence the sage is\nFor the belly\nNot for the eye.\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
        "13": "Favor and disgrace are things that startle;\nHigh rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble.\nWhat is meant by saying favor and disgrace are things that startle?\nFavor when it is bestowed on a subject serves to startle as much as when it is withdrawn.\nThis is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace are things that startle.\nWhat is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble?\nThe reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body, what trouble have I?\nHence he who values his body more than dominion over the empire can be entrusted with the empire.\nHe who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given the custody of the empire.",
        "14": "What cannot be seen is called evanescent;\nWhat cannot be heard is called rarefied;\nWhat cannot be touched is called minute.\nThese three cannot be fathomed\nAnd so they are confused and looked upon as one.\nIts upper part is not dazzling;\nIts lower part is not obscure.\nDimly visible, it cannot be named\nAnd returns to that which is without substance.\nThis is called the shape that has no shape,\nThe image that is without substance.\nThis is called indistinct and shadowy.\nGo up to it and you will not see its head;\nFollow behind it and you will not see its rear.\nHold fast to the way of antiquity\nIn order to keep in control the realm of today.\nThe ability to know the beginning of antiquity\nIs called the thread running through the way.",
        "15": "Of old he who was well versed in the way\nWas minutely subtle, mysteriously comprehending,\nAnd too profound to be known.\nIt is because he could not be known\nThat he can only be given a makeshift description:\nTentative, as if fording a river in winter,\nHesitant, as if in fear of his neighbors;\nFormal like a guest;\nFalling apart like the thawing ice;\nThick like the uncarved block;\nVacant like a valley;\nMurky like muddy water.\nWho can be muddy and yet, settling, slowly become limpid?\nWho can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life?\nHe who holds fast to this way\nDesires not to be full.\nIt is because he is not full\nThat he can be worn and yet newly made.",
        "16": "I do my utmost to attain emptiness;\nI hold firmly to stillness.\nThe myriad creatures all rise together\nAnd I watch their return.\nThe teaming creatures\nAll return to their separate roots.\nReturning to one's roots is known as stillness.\nThis is what is meant by returning to one's destiny.\nReturning to one's destiny is known as the constant.\nKnowledge of the constant is known as discernment.\nWoe to him who wilfully innovates\nWhile ignorant of the constant,\nBut should one act from knowledge of the constant\nOne's action will lead to impartiality,\nImpartiality to kingliness,\nKingliness to heaven,\nHeaven to the way,\nThe way to perpetuity,\nAnd to the end of one's days one will meet with no danger.",
        "17": "The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects.\nNext comes the ruler they love and praise;\nNext comes one they fear;\nNext comes one with whom they take liberties.\nWhen there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.\nHesitant, he does not utter words lightly.\nWhen his task is accomplished and his work done\nThe people all say, 'It happened to us naturally.'",
        "18": "When the great way falls into disuse\nThere are benevolence and rectitude;\nWhen cleverness emerges\nThere is great hypocrisy;\nWhen the six relations are at variance\nThere are filial children;\nWhen the state is benighted\nThere are loyal ministers.",
        "19": "Exterminate learning and there will no longer be worries.\nExterminate the sage, discard the wise,\nAnd the people will benefit a hundredfold;\nExterminate benevolence, discard rectitude,\nAnd the people will again be filial;\nExterminate ingenuity, discard profit,\nAnd there will be no more thieves and bandits.\nThese three, being false adornments, are not enough\nAnd the people must have something to which they can attach themselves:\nExhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block,\nHave little thought of self and as few desires as possible.",
        "20": "Between yea and nay\nHow much difference is there?\nBetween good and evil\nHow great is the distance?\nWhat others fear\nOne must also fear.\nThe multitude are joyous\nAs if partaking of the offering\nOr going up to a terrace in spring.\nI alone am inactive and reveal no signs,\nAnd wax without having reached the limit.\nLike a baby that has not yet learned to smile,\nListless as though with no home to go back to.\nThe multitude all have more than enough.\nI alone seem to be in want.\nMy mind is that of a fool - how blank!\nVulgar people are clear.\nI alone am drowsy.\nVulgar people are alert.\nI alone am muddled.\nCalm like the sea;\nLike a high wind that never ceases.\nThe multitude all have a purpose.\nI alone am foolish and uncouth.\nI alone am different from others\nAnd value being fed by the mother.",
        "21": "In his every movement a man of great virtue\nFollows the way and the way only.\nAs a thing the way is\nShadowy and indistinct.\nIndistinct and shadowy,\nYet within it is an image;\nShadowy and indistinct,\nYet within it is a substance.\nDim and dark,\nYet within it is an essence.\nThis essence is quite genuine\nAnd within it is something that can be tested.\nFrom the present back to antiquity,\nIts name never deserted it.\nIt serves as a means for inspecting the fathers of the multitude.\nHow do I know that the fathers of the multitude are like that?\nBy means of this.",
        "22": "Bowed down then preserved;\nBent then straight;\nHollow then full;\nWorn then new;\nA little then benefited;\nA lot then perplexed.\nTherefore the sage embraces the One and is a model for the empire.\nHe does not show himself, and so is conspicuous;\nHe does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious;\nHe does not brag, and so has merit;\nHe does not boast, and so endures.\nIt is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.\nThe way the ancients had it, 'Bowed down then preserved', is no empty saying.\nTruly it enables one to be preserved to the end.",
        "23": "To use words but rarely\nIs to be natural.\nHence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day.\nWho is it that produces these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man.\nThat is why one follows the way.\nA man of the way conforms to the way;\nA man of virtue conforms to virtue;\nA man of loss conforms to loss.\nHe who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way;\nHe who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue;\nHe who conforms to loss is gladly accepted by loss.\nWhen there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.",
        "24": "He who tiptoes cannot stand; he who strides cannot walk.\nHe who shows himself is not conspicuous;\nHe who considers himself right is not illustrious;\nHe who brags will have no merit;\nHe who boasts will not endure.\nFrom the point of view of the way these are 'excessive food and useless excresences'.\nAs there are Things that detest them, he who has the way does not abide in them.",
        "25": "There is a thing confusedly formed,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nGoes round and does not weary.\nIt is capable of being the mother of the world.\nI know not its name\nSo I style it 'the way'.\nI give it the makeshift name of 'the great'.\nBeing great, it is further described as receding,\nReceding, it is described as far away,\nBeing far away, it is described as turning back.\nHence the way is great;\nHeaven is great;\nEarth is great;\nThe king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four things that are great,\nAnd the king counts as one.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth on heaven,\nHeaven on the way,\nAnd the way on that which is naturally so.",
        "26": "The heavy is the root of the light;\nThe still is the lord of the restless.\nTherefore the gentleman when travelling all day\nNever lets the heavily laden carts out of his sight.\nIt is only when he is safely behind walls and watch-towers\nThat he rests peacefully and is above worries.\nHow, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nMake light of his own person in the eyes of the empire?\nIf light, then the root is lost;\nIf restless, then the lord is lost.",
        "27": "One who excels in travelling leaves no wheel tracks;\nOne who excels in speech makes no slips;\nOne who excels in reckoning uses no counting rods;\nOne who excels in shutting uses no bolts yet what he has shut cannot be opened.\nOne who excels in tying uses no cords yet what he has tied cannot be undone.\nTherefore the sage always excels in saving people, and so abandons no one;\nAlways excels in saving things, and so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following one's discernment.\nHence the good man is the teacher the bad learns from;\nAnd the bad man is the material the good works on.\nNot to value the teacher\nNor to love the material\nThough it seems clever, betrays great bewilderment.\nThis is called the essential and the secret.",
        "28": "Know the male\nBut keep to the role of the female\nAnd be a ravine to the empire.\nIf you are a ravine to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not desert you\nAnd you will again return to being a babe.\nKnow the white\nBut keep to the role of the sullied\nAnd be a model to the empire.\nIf you are a model to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not be wanting\nAnd you will return to the infinite,\nKnow honour\nBut keep to the role of the disgraced\nAnd be a valley to the empire.\nIf you are a valley to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will be sufficient\nAnd you will return to being the uncarved block.\nWhen the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels.\nThe sage makes use of these and becomes the lord over the officials.\nHence the greatest cutting does not sever.",
        "29": "Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite.\nThe empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nwhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\nHence some things lead and some follow;\nSome breathe gently and some breathe hard;\nSome are strong and some are weak;\nSome destroy and some are destroyed.\nTherefore the sage avoids excess, extravagance, and arrogance.",
        "30": "One who assists the ruler of men by means of the way does not intimidate the empire by a show of arms.\nThis is something which is liable to rebound.\nWhere troops have encamped\nThere will brambles grow;\nIn the wake of a mighty army\nBad harvests follow without fail.\nOne who is good aims only at bringing his campaign to a conclusion and dare not thereby intimidate.\nBring it to a conclusion but do not brag;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant;\nBring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not intimidate.\nA creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.\nThat which goes against the way will come to an early end.",
        "31": "It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use.\nThe gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war.\nArms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.\nWhen one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.\nThere is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men.\nOne who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire.\nOn occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;\nOn occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.\nA lieutenants place is on the left;\nThe general's place is on the right.\nThis means that it is mourning rites that are observed.\nWhen great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow.\nWhen victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.",
        "32": "The way is for ever nameless.\nThough the uncarved block is small\nNo one in the world dare claim its allegiance.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it\nThe myriad creatures will submit of their own accord,\nHeaven and earth will unite and sweet dew will fall,\nAnd the people will be equitable, though no one so decrees.\nOnly when it is cut are there names.\nAs soon as there are names\nOne ought to know that it is time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop one can be free from danger.\nThe way is to the world as the River and the Sea are to rivulets and streams.",
        "33": "He who knows others is clever;\nHe who knows himself has discernment.\nHe who overcomes others has force;\nHe who overcomes himself is strong.\nHe who knows contentment is rich;\nHe who perseveres is a man of purpose;\nHe who does not lose his station will endure;\nHe who lives out his days has had a long life.",
        "34": "The way is broad, reaching left as well as right.\nThe myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master.\nFor ever free of desire, it can be called small;\nYet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called great.\nIt is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeeds in becoming great.",
        "35": "Have in your hold the great image\nAnd the empire will come to you.\nComing to you and meeting with no harm\nIt will be safe and sound.\nMusic and food\nWill induce the wayfarer to stop.\nThe way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt cannot be heard,\nYet it cannot be exhausted by use.",
        "36": "If you would have a thing shrink,\nYou must first stretch it;\nIf you would have a thing weakened,\nYou must first strengthen it;\nIf you would have a thing laid aside,\nYou must first set it up;\nIf you would take from a thing,\nYou must first give to it.\nThis is called subtle discernment:\nThe submissive and weak will overcome the hard and strong.\nThe fish must not be allowed to leave the deep;\nThe instruments of power in a state must not be revealed to anyone.",
        "37": "The way never acts, yet nothing is left undone.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,\nThe myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord.\nAfter they are transformed, should desire raise its head,\nI shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block.\nThe nameless uncarved block\nIs but freedom from desire,\nAnd if I cease to desire and remain still,\nThe empire will be at peace of its own accord.",
        "38": "A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue.\nA man of the lowest virtue never strays from virtue and that is why he is without virtue.\nThe former never acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe latter acts but there are things left undone.\nA man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive.\nA man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive.\nA man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.\nHence when the way was lost there was virtue;\nWhen virtue was lost there was benevolence;\nWhen benevolence was lost there was rectitude;\nWhen rectitude was lost there were the rites.\nThe rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith\nAnd the beginning of disorder;\nForeknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way\nAnd the beginning of folly.\nHence the man of large mind abides in the thick not in the thin, in the fruit not in the flower.\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
        "39": "Of old, these came to be in possession of the One:\nHeaven in virtue of the One is limpid;\nEarth in virtue of the One is settled;\nGods in virtue of the One have their potencies;\nThe valley in virtue of the One is full;\nThe myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive;\nLords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire.\nIt is the One that makes these what they are.\nWithout what makes it limpid heaven might split;\nWithout what makes it settled earth might sink;\nWithout what gives them their potencies gods might spend themselves;\nWithout what makes it full the valley might run dry;\nWithout what keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish;\nWithout what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall.\nHence the superior must have the inferior as root;\nThe high must have the low as base.\nThus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'.\nThis is taking the inferior as root, is it not?\nHence the highest renown is without renown,\nNot wishing to be one among many like jade\nNor to be aloof like stone.",
        "40": "Turning back is how the way moves;\nWeakness is the means the way employs.\nThe myriad creatures in the world are born from\nSomething, and Something from Nothing.",
        "41": "When the best student hears about the way\nHe practises it assiduously;\nWhen the average student hears about the way\nIt seems to him there one moment and gone the next;\nWhen the worst student hears about the way\nHe laughs out loud.\nIf he did not laugh\nIt would be unworthy of being the way.\nHence the Chien yen has it:\nThe way that is bright seems dull;\nThe way that is forward seems to lead backward;\nThe way that is even seems rough.\nThe highest virtue is like the valley;\nThe sheerest whiteness seems sullied;\nAmple virtue seems defective;\nVigorous virtue seems indolent;\nPlain virtue seems soiled;\nThe great square has no corners.\nThe great vessel takes long to complete;\nThe great note is rarefied in sound;\nThe great image has no shape.\nThe way conceals itself in being nameless.\nIt is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.",
        "42": "The way begets one;\nOne begets two;\nTwo begets three;\nThree begets the myriad creatures.\nThe myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two.\nThere are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves.\nThus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to.\nWhat others teach I also teach.\n'The violent shall not come to a natural end.'\nI shall take this as my precept.",
        "43": "The most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the hardest in the world—that which is without substance entering that which has no crevices.\n\nThat is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action.The teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action, these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world.",
        "44": "Your name or your person,\nWhich is dearer?\nYour person or your goods,\nWhich is worth more?\nGain or loss,\nWhich is a greater bane?\nThat is why excessive meanness\nIs sure to lead to great expense;\nToo much store\nIs sure to end in immense loss.\nKnow contentment\nAnd you will suffer no disgrace;\nKnow when to stop\nAnd you will meet with no danger.\nYou can then endure.",
        "45": "Great perfection seems chipped,\nYet use will not wear it out;\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nYet use will not drain it;\nGreat straightness seems bent;\nGreat skill seems awkward;\nGreat eloquence seems tongue-tied.\nRestlessness overcomes cold;\nStillness overcomes heat.\nLimpid and still,\nOne can be a leader in the empire.",
        "46": "When the way prevails in the empire, fleet-footed horses are relegated to ploughing in the fields;\nWhen the way does not prevail in the empire, war-horses breed on the border.\nThere is no crime greater than having too many desires;\nThere is no disaster greater than not being content;\nThere is no misfortune greater than being covetous.\nHence in being content, one will always have enough.",
        "47": "Without stirring abroad\nOne can know the whole world;\nWithout looking out the window\nOne can see the way of heaven.\nThe further one goes\nThe less one knows.\nTherefore the sage knows without having to stir,\nIdentifies without having to see,\nAccomplishes without having to act.",
        "48": "In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day;\nIn the pursuit of the way one does less every day.\nOne does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one does nothing at all there is nothing that is undone.\nIt is always through not meddling that the empire is won.\nShould you meddle, then you are not equal to the task of winning the empire.",
        "49": "The sage has no mind of his own.\nHe takes as his own the mind of the people.\nThose who are good I treat as good.\nThose who are not good I also treat as good.\nIn so doing I gain in goodness.\nThose who are of good faith I have faith in.\nThose who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in.\nIn so doing I gain in good faith.\nThe sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it.\nThe people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children.",
        "50": "When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so? Because they set too much store by life.\nI have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.\nThere is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;\nThere is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;\nThere is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.\nWhy is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.",
        "51": "The way gives them life;\nVirtue rears them;\nThings give them shape;\nCircumstances bring them to maturity.\nTherefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.\nYet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\nThus the way gives them life and rears them;\nBrings them up and nurses them;\nBrings them to fruition and maturity;\nFeeds and shelters them.\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue.",
        "52": "The world had a beginning\nAnd this beginning could be the mother of the world.\nWhen you know the mother\nGo on to know the child.\nAfter you have known the child\nGo back to holding fast to the mother,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.\nBlock the openings,\nShut the doors,\nAnd all your life you will not run dry.\nUnblock the openings,\nAdd to your troubles,\nAnd to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.\nTo see the small is called discernment;\nTo hold fast to the submissive is called strength.\nUse the light\nBut give up the discernment.\nBring not misfortune upon yourself.\nThis is known as following the constant.",
        "53": "Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.\nThe great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.\nThe court is corrupt,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty;\nYet there are those dressed in fineries,\nWith swords at their sides,\nFilled with food and drink,\nAnd possessed of too much wealth.\nThis is known as taking the lead in robbery.\nFar indeed is this from the way.",
        "54": "What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out;\nWhat is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose;\nThrough this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end.\nCultivate it in your person\nAnd its virtue will be genuine;\nCultivate it in the family\nAnd its virtue will be more than sufficient;\nCultivate it in the hamlet\nAnd its virtue will endure;\nCultivate it in the state\nAnd its virtue will abound;\nCultivate it in the empire\nAnd its virtue will be pervasive.\nHence look at the person through the person;\nLook at the family through the family;\nLook at the hamlet through the hamlet;\nLook at the state through the state;\nLook at the empire through the empire.\nHow do I know that the empire is like that?\nBy means of this.",

        "67": "All the world thinks that my Tao is great;\nAnd yet it seems inconceivable.\nOnly its greatness makes it seem inconceivable.\nIf it could be conceived of,\nIt would have become insignificant long ago.\n\nI have Three Treasures that support and protect;\nThe first is compassion.\nThe second is moderation.\nThe third is daring not to be first in the world.\n\nWith compassion one becomes courageous;\nWith moderation one becomes expansive.\nIn daring not to be first in the world,\nOne becomes the instrument of leadership.\n\nNow if one is courageous without compassion,\nOr expansive without moderation,\nOr first without holding back,\nOne is doomed!\n\nCompassion always triumphs when attacked;\nIt brings security when maintained.\nNature aids its leaders\nBy arming them with compassion.",
        "68": "A skillful leader does not use force.\nA skillful fighter does not feel anger.\nA skillful master does not engage the opponent.\nA skillful employer remains low.\n\nThis is called the power in not contending.\nThis is called the strength to employ others.\nThis is called the highest emulation of Nature.",
        "69": "The strategists have a saying:\n\"I dare not act as a host,\nYet I act as a guest,\nI dare not advance an inch,\nYet I retreat a foot.\"\n\nThis is called\nTraveling without moving,\nRising  without arms,\nProjecting without resistance,\nCapturing without strategies.\n\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating resistance;\nUnderestimating resistance will destroy my Treasures.\nThus when mutually opposing strategies escalate,\nThe one who feels sorrow will triumph.",
        "70": "Very easy to follow.\nYet the world is unable to know them,\nUnable to follow them.\n\nMy words have a source,\nMy efforts have mastery.\nIndeed, since none know this,\nThey do not know me.\nThe rare ones who know me\nMust treasure me.\n\nTherefore, Evolved Individuals\nWear a coarse cloth covering\nWith precious jade at the center.",
        "71": "To know that you do not know is best.\nTo not know of knowing is a disease.\n\nIndeed, to be sick of the disease,\nIs the way to be free of the disease.\n\nEvolved Individuals are free of the disease,\nBecause they are sick of the disease.\n\nThis is the way to be free of disease.",
        "72": "If the people do not fear authority,\nThen authority will expand.\nDo not disrespect their position;\nDo not reject their lives.\nSince indeed they are not rejected,\nThey do not reject.\n\nTherefore, enlightened people know themselves,\nBut do not display themselves.\nThey love themselves,\nBut do not treasure themselves.\n\nHence they discard one and receive the other.",
        "73": "Those bold in not daring will survive.\nOf these two, either may benefit or harm.\n\nNature decides which is evil,\nBut who can know why?\nEven Evolved Individuals regard this as difficult.\n\nThe Tao in Nature\nDoes not contend,\nYet skillfully triumphs.\nDoes not speak,\nYet skillfully responds.\nDoes not summon,\nAnd yet attracts.\nDoes not hasten,\nYet skillfully designs.\n\nNature's network is vast, so vast,\nIts mesh is coarse, yet nothing slips through.",
        "74": "When people do not fear death,\nHow can they be threatened with death?\nSuppose people fear death and still do not conform,\nWho would dare seize them and put them to death?\n\nThere is always the Master Executioner who kills.\nTo substitute for the Master Executioner in killing\nIs like substituting for the Master Carpenter who carves.\nWhoever substitutes for the Master Carpenter in carving,\nRarely escapes injury to his hands.",
        "75": "People are hungry.\nBecause those above consume too much in taxes,\nPeople are hungry.\n\nPeople are difficult to lead.\nBecause those above interfere with them,\nPeople are difficult to lead.\n\nPeople make light of death.\nBecause those above deeply seek survival,\nPeople make light of death.\n\nIndeed, it is those who do not interfere with life\nWho are capable of respecting life.",
        "76": "A man living is yielding and receptive.\nDying, he is rigid and inflexible.\nAll Things, the grass and trees:\nLiving, they are yielding and fragile;\nDying, they are dry and withered.\n\nThus those who are firm and inflexible\nAre in harmony with dying.\nThose who are yielding and receptive\nAre in harmony with living.\n\nTherefore an inflexible strategy will not triumph;\nAn inflexible tree will be attacked.\nThe position of the highly inflexible will descend;\nThe position of the yielding and receptive will ascend.",
        "77": "The Tao in Nature\nIs like a bow that is stretched.\nThe top is pulled down,\nThe bottom is raised .\nWhat is excessive is reduced,\nWhat is insufficient is supplemented.\n\nThe Tao in Nature\nReduces the excessive\nAnd supplements the insufficient.\nThe Tao in Man is not so;\nHe reduces the insufficient,\nBecause he serves the excessive.\n\nWho then can use excess to serve the world?\nThose who possess the Tao.\n\nTherefore Evolved Individuals\nAct without expectation,\nSucceed without taking credit,\nAnd have no desire to display their excellence.",
        "78": "Nothing in the world,\nIs as yielding and receptive as water;\nYet in attacking the firm and inflexible,\nNothing triumphs so well.\nBecause of what it is not,\nThis becomes easy.\n\nThe receptive triumphs over the inflexible;\nThe yielding triumphs over the rigid.\nNone in the world do not know this.\nNone have the ability to practice it.\n\nTherefore Evolved Individuals say:\nOne who accepts the disgrace of the organization\nCan be called the leader of the grain shrine.\nOne who accepts the misfortunes of the organization\nCan be called the leader of the world.\n\nRight words appear to reverse themselves.",
        "79": "Even when a great resentment is reconciled,\nSome resentment must linger,\nHow can this be made good?\n\nThat is why Evolved Individuals\nHold the left side of the contract\nAnd do not censure others.\nThose with Power are in charge of the contract;\nThose without Power are in charge of resolving it.\n\nThe Tao in Nature has no favorites.\nIt always works through the good person.",
        "80": "In a small organization with a few people;\n\nLet there be ten or a hundred times\nMore tools than they can use.\nLet the people value their lives\nAnd yet not move far away.\nEven though there are boats and carriages,\nThere is no occasion to use them.\nEven though there are armor and weapons,\nThere is no occasion to display them.\n\nLet the people again knot cords and use them.\nTheir food will be pleasing.\nTheir clothes will be fine.\nTheir homes will be secure.\nTheir customs will be joyful.\n\nNearby organizations may watch each other;\nTheir crowing and barking may be heard.\nYet the people may grow old and die\nWithout coming or going between them.",
        "81": "Embellished words are not sincere.\nThose who are good are not defensive;\nThose who are defensive are not good.\nThose who know are not erudite;\nThose who are erudite do not know.\n\nEvolved Individuals do not accumulate.\nThe more they do for others, the more they gain;\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess.\n\nThe Tao of Nature\nIs to serve without spoiling.\nThe Tao of Evolved Individuals\nIs to act wihtout contending."
