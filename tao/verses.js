        "7": "Heaven is eternal., the Earth everlasing.\nThey can be eternal and everlasting\nBecause they do not exist for themselves.\nFor that reason tehy can exist eternally.\n\nTherefore, Evolved Individuals\nPut themselves last,\nAnd yet they are first.\nPut themselves outside,\nAnd yet they remain.\n\nIs it not because they are without self-interest\nThat their interests succeed?",
        "8": "The highest value is like water.\n\nThe value in water benefits All Things,\nAnd yet it does not contend.\nIt stays in places that others disdain,\nAnd therefore is close to the Tao.\n\nThe value in a dwelling is location.\nThe value in a mind is depth.\nThe value in relations is benevolence.\nThe value in words is sincerity.\nThe value in leadership is order.\nThe value in work is competence.\nThe value in effort is timeliness.\n\nSince, indeed, they do not contend,\nThere is no resentment.",

        "17": "Superior leaders are those whose existence is merely known;\nThe next best are loved and honored;\nThe next are respected;\nAnd the next are ridiculed.\n\nThose who lack belief\nWill not in turn be believed.\nBut when the command comes from afar\nAnd the work is done, the goal achieved,\nThe people say, \"We did it naturally.\"",

        "22": "What is curved becomes whole;\nWhat is crooked becomes straight.\nWhat is deep becomes filled;\nWhat is exhausted becomes refreshed.\nWhat is small becomes attainable;\nWhat is excessive becomes confused.\n\nThus Evolved Individuals hold to the One\nAnd regard the world as their Pattern.\n\nThey do not display themselves;\nTherefore they are illuminated.\nThey do not define themselves;\nTherefore they are distinguished.\nThey do not make claims;\nTherefore they are credited.\nThey do not boast;\nTherefore tehy advance.\n\nSince, indeed, they do not compete,\nThe world cannot compete with them.\n\nThat ancient saying: \"What is curved becomes whole\" -\nAre these empty words?\nTo become whole,\nTurn within.",

        "26": "Gravity is the foundation of levity.\nStillness is the master of agitation.\n\nThus Evolved Individuals can travel the whole day\nWithout leaving behind their baggage.\nHowever arresting the views,\nThey remain calm and unattached.\nHow can leaders with ten thousand chariots\nHave a light-hearted position in the world?\n\nIf they are light-hearted, they lose their foundation.\nIf they are agitated, they lose their mastery.",

        "29": "Those who would take hold of the world and act on it,\nNever, I notice, succeed.\n\nThe world is a mysterious instrument,\nNot made to be handled.\nThose who act on it, spoil it.\nThose who seize it, lose it.\n\nSo, in Natural Law\nSome lead, some follow;\nSome agitate, some remain silent;\nSome are firm, some are weak;\nSome carry on, some lose heart.\n\nThus, Evolved Individuals\nAvoid extremes,\nAvoid extravagance,\nAvoid excess.",
        "30": "Those who use the Tao to guide leaders\nDo not use forceful strategies in the world.\nSuch matters tend to recoil.\n\nWhere armies are positioned,\nThorny brambles are produced.\nA great military always brings years of hunger.\n\nThose who are skillful\nSucceed and then stop.\nThey dare not hold on with force.\n\nThey succeed and do not boast.\nThey succeed and do not make claims.\nThey succeed and are not proud.\nThey succeed and do not acquire in excess.\nThey succeed and do not force.\n\nThings overgrown will always decline.\nThis is not the Tao.\nWhat is not the Tao will soon end.",
        "31": "The finest weapons can be the instruments of misfortune,\nAnd thus contrary to Natural Law.\nThose who possess teh Tao turn away from them.\nEvolved leaders occupy and honor the left;\nThose who use weapons honor the right.\n\nWeapons are instruments of misfortune\nThat are used by the unevolved.\nWhen their use is unavoidable,\nThe superior act with calm restraint.\n\nEven when victorious, let there be no joy,\nFor such joy leads to contentment with slaughter.\nThose who are content with slaughter\nCannot find fulfillment in the world.",
        "32": "The Tao of the Absolute has no name.\nAlthough infinitesimal in its Simplicity,\nThe world cannot master it.\n\nIf leaders would hold on to it,\nAll Things would naturally follow.\nHeaven and Earth would unite to rain Sweet Dew,\nAnd people would naturally cooperate without commands.\n\nNames emerge when institutions begin.\nWhen names emerge, know likewise to stop.\nTo know when to stop is to be free of danger.\n\nThe presence of the Tao in the world\nIs like the valley streawm joining the rivers and seas.",
        "33": "Those who know themselves have insight.\nThose who master others have force;\nThose who master themselves have strength.\n\nThose who know what is enough are wealthy.\nThose who persevere have direction.\nThose who maintain their position endure.\nAnd those who die and yet do not perish, live on.",
        "34": "The Great Tao extends everywhere.\nIt is on the left and the right.\n\nAll Things depend on it for growth,\nAnd it does not deny them.\nIt achieves its purpose,\nAnd it does not have a name.\nIt clothes and cultivates All Things,\nAnd it does not act as master.\n\nAlways without desire,\nIt can be named Small.\nAll Things merge with it,\nAnd it does not act as master.\nIt can be named Great.\n\nIn the end it does not seek greatness,\nAnd in that way the Great is achieved.",
        "35": "Hold fast to the Great Image,\nAnd all the world will come.\nYet its coming brings no harm,\nOnly peace and order.\n\nWhen there is music together with food,\nThe audience will linger.\nBut when the Tao is expressed,\nIt seems without substance or flavor.\n\nWe observe and there is nothing to see.\nWe listen and there is nothing to hear.\nWe use it and it is without end.",
        "36": "In order to deplete it,\nIt must be thoroughly extended.\nIn order to weaken it,\nIt must be thoroughly strengthened.\nIn order to reject it,\nIt must be thoroughly promoted.\nIn order to take away from it,\nIt must be thoroughly endowed.\n\nThis is called a Subtle Insight.\nThe yielding can triumph over teh inflexible;\nThe weak can triumph over the strong.\nFish should not be taken from deep waters;\nNor should organizations make obvious their advantages.",
        "37": "The Tao never acts,\nAnd yet is never inactive.\n\nIf leaders can hold on to it,\nAll Things will be naturally influenced.\nInfluenced and yet desiring to act,\nI would calm them with Nameless Simplicity.\nNameless Simplicity is likewise without desire;\nAnd without desire there is harmony.\n\nThe world will then be naturally stabilized.",
        "38": "Superior Power is never Powerful, thus it has Power.\nInferior Power is always Powerful, thus it has no Power.\nSuperior Power takes no action and acts withotu motive.\nInferior Power takes action and acts with motive.\n\nSuperior philanthropy takes action and acts without motive.\nSuperior morality takes action and acts with motive.\nSuperior propriety takes action and there is no response;\nSo it raises its arm to project itself.\n\nTherefore, lose the Tao and Power follows.\nLose the Power and philanthropy follows.\nLose philanthropy and morality follows.\nLose morality and propriety follows.\n\nOne who has propriety has the veneer of truth\nAnd yet is the leader of confusion.\nOne who knows the future has the luster of the Tao\nAnd yet is ignorant of its origins.\n\nTherefore those wiht the greatest endurance\nCan enter the substantial,\nNot occupy its veneer;\nCan enter reality,\nNot occupy its luster.\nHence they discard one and receive the other.",
        "39": "From old, these may have harmony with the One:\n\nHeaven in harmony with the One becomes clear.\nEarth in harmony with the One becomes stable.\nMind in harmony with the One becomes inspired.\nValleys in harmony wiht the One become full.\nAll Things in harmony with the One becomes creawtive.\nLeaders in harmony with the One becomes incorruptible in the world.\n\nThese were attained through Oneness.\n\nHeaven without clarity would probably crack.\nEarth without stability would probably quake.\nMind without inspiration would probably sleep.\nValleys without fullness would probably dry .\nAll Things without creativity would probably die off.\nLeaders without incorruptible ways would probably stumble and fall.\n\nIndeed, the high-placed stem from teh humble;\nThe elevated are based upon the lowly.\nThis is why leaders call themselves\nAlone, lonely, and unfavored.\nIs this not because they stem form the humble and common?\nIs it not?\n\nTherefore, attain honor without being honored.\nDo not desire to shine like jade; wear ornaments as if they were stone.",
        "40": "Receptivity is the way it is used.\nThe world and All Things were produced from its existence.\nIts existence was produced from nonexistence.",
        "41": "When superior leaders hear of the Tao,\nThey diligently try to practice it.\nWhen average leaders hear of the Tao,\nThey appear both aware and unaware of it.\nWhen inferior leaders hear of the Tao,\nThey roar with laughter.\n\nWithout sufficient laughter, it could not be the Tao;\nHence the long-established sayings:\n\nThe Tao illuminated appears to be obscure;\nThe Tao advancing apperaas to be retreating;\nThe Tao leveled appears to be uneven.\n\nSuperior Power appears to be low;\nGreat clarity appears to be spotted;\nExtensive Power appears to be insufficient;\nEstablished Power appers to be stolen;\nSubstantial Power appears to be spurious.\n\nThe greatest space has no corners;\nThe greatest talents are slowly mastered;\nThe greatest music has the rarest sound;\nThe Great Image has no form.\n\nThe Tao is hidden and nameless,\nYet it is the Tao that skillfully supports and completes.",
        "42": "The Tao produced the One.\nThe One produced the Two.\nThe Two produced the Three.\nThe Three produced All Things.\n\nAll Things carry Yin and hold to Yang;\nTheir blended Influence brings Harmony.\n\nPeople hate to be alone, lonely, and unfavored;\nAnd yet leaders take these names.\n\nThus in Natural Law\nSome lose and in this way profit.\nSome profit and in this way lose.\n\nWhat others have taught, I also teach:\nThose who are violent do not die naturally.\nI will make this my chief teaching.",
        "43": "Overtake the most rigid parts of the world.\nThe insubstantial can penetrate continually.\n\nTherefore I know that wihtout action there is advantage.\n\nThis philosophy wtihout words,\nThis advantage wtihout action -\nIt is rare, in the world, to attain them.",
        "44": "Which is dearer,\nName or life?\nWhich means more,\nLife or wealth?\nWhich is worse,\nGain or loss?\n\nThe stronger the attachments,\nThe greater the cost.\nThe more that is hoarded,\nThe deeper the loss.\n\nKnow what is enough;\nBe without disgrace.\nKnow when to stop;\nBe without danger.\n\nIn this way one lasts for a very long time.",

        "46": "Even fast horses are used for their dung.\nWhen the world is without the Tao,\nWar-horses are raised in the suburbs.\n\nThere is no greater misfortune\nThan not knowing what is enough.\nThere is no greater fault\nThan desiring to acquire.\n\nTherefore know that enough is enough.\nThere will always be enough.",
        "47": "Without going out of doors,\nKnow the world.\nWithout looking through the window,\nSee the Tao in Nature.\nOne may travel very far,\nAnd know very little.\n\nTherefore, Evolved Individuals\nKnow without going about,\nRecognize without looking,\nAchieve without acting.",
        "48": "To pursue the academic, add to it daily.\nTo pursue the Tao, subtract from it daily.\nSubtract and subtract again,\nTo arrive at nonaction.\nThrough nonaction nothing is left undone.\n\nThe world is always held wtihout effort.\nThe moment there is effort,\nThe world is beyond holding.",
        "49": "Evolved Individuals have no fixed mind;\nThey make the mind of the People their mind.\n\nTo those who are good, I am good;\nTo those who are not good, I am also good.\nGoodness is Power.\n\nOf those who trust, I am trusting;\nOf those who do not trust, I am also trusting.\nTrust is Power.\n\nThe Evolved Individuals in the world\nAttract the world and merge with its mind.\nThe People all focus their eyes and ears;\nEvolved Individuals all act as infants.",
        "50": "As life goes out, death comes in.\n\nLife has thirteen paths;\nDeath has thirteen paths.\nHuman life arrives at the realm of death\nAlso in thirteen moves.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause life is lived lavishly.\n\nNow, as it is well known,\nThose skilled in attracting life\nCan travel across the land\nAnd not meet a rhinoceros or tiger.\nWhen the military comes in,\nTheir defence cannot be attacked.\n\nThe rhinoceros is without a place to thrust its horn.\nThe tiger is without a place to affix its claw.\nThe military is without a place to admit its blade.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they are without the realm of death.",
        "51": "The Tao produces;\nIts Power supports;\nIts Natural Law forms;\nIts influence completes.\n\nThus All Things without exception\nRespect the Tao and value its Power.\nTo respect teh Tao and value its Power -\nNo one demands this, and it comes naturally.\n\nTherefore the Tao produces and its Power supports;\nIt advances, cultivates, comforts, matures, nourishes, and protects.\n\nProduce but do not possess.\nAct without expectation.\nAdvance without dominating.\nThese are called the Subtle Powers.",
        "52": "The beginning of the world\nMay be regarded as the Mother of the world.\nTo apprehend the Mother,\nKnow the offspring.\nTo know the offspring\nIs to remain close to the Mother,\nAnd free from harm throughout life.\n\nBlock the passages,\nClose the doors;\nIn the end, life is idle.\n\nOpen the pasages,\nIncrease undertakings;\nIn the end, life is hopeless.\n\nTo perceive the small is called insight.\nTo remain yielding is called strength.\nIf, in using one's brightness,\nOne returns to insight,\nLife will be free of misfortune.\n\nThis is called learning the Absolute.",

(So Heaven) diminishes where\nthere is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency.\nIt is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to\nsupplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes\naway from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.\nWho can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under\nheaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!\nTherefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as\nhis; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he\ndoes not wish to display his superiority.",
        "78": "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water,\nand yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing\nthat can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual)\nfor which it can be changed.\nEvery one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and\nthe weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.\nTherefore a sage has said,\n'He who accepts his state's reproach,\nIs hailed therefore its altars' lord;\nTo him who bears men's direful woes\nThey all the name of King accord.'\nWords that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.",
        "79": "When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a\ngreat animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind\nof the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the\nother)?\nTherefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand\nportion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the\n(speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the\nattributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the\nengagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the\nconditions favourable to himself.\nIn the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always\non the side of the good man.",
        "80": "In a little state with a small population, I would so order it,\nthat, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a\nhundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the\npeople, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove\nelsewhere (to avoid it).\nThough they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion\nto ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they\nshould have no occasion to don or use them.\nI would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead\nof the written characters).\nThey should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes\nbeautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common\n(simple) ways sources of enjoyment.\nThere should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices\nof the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I\nwould make the people to old age, even to death, not have any\nintercourse with it.",
        "81": "Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those\nwho are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the\ndisputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not\nextensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.\nThe sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he\nexpends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that\nhe gives to others, the more does he have himself.\nWith all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with\nall the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive."
