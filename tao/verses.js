    "Lau": {
        "1": "The way that can be spoken of\nIs not the constant way;\nThe name that can be named\nIs not the constant name.\nThe nameless was the beginning of heaven and earth;\nThe named was the mother of the myriad creatures.\nHence always rid yourself of desires in order to observe its secrets;\nBut always allow yourself to have desires in order to observe its manifestations.\nThese two are the same\nBut diverge in name as they issue forth.\nBeing the same they are called mysteries,\nMystery upon mystery -\nThe gateway of the manifold secrets.",
        "2": "The whole world recognizes the beautiful as the beautiful, yet this is only the ugly;\nthe whole world recognizes the good as the good, yet this is only the bad.\nThus Something and Nothing produce each other;\nThe difficult and the easy complement each other;\nThe long and the short off-set each other;\nThe high and the low incline towards each other;\nNote and sound harmonize with each other;\nBefore and after follow each other.\nTherefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practises the teaching that uses no words.\nThe myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority;\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt is because it lays claim to no merit\nThat its merit never deserts it.",
        "3": "Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention;\nnot to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft;\nnot to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind.\nTherefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones.\nHe always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and ensures that the clever never dare to act.\nDo that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail.",
        "4": "The way is empty, yet use will not drain it.\nDeep, it is like the ancestor of the myriad creatures.\nBlunt the sharpness;\nUntangle the knots;\nSoften the glare;\nLet your wheels move only along old ruts.\nDarkly visible, it only seems as if it were there.\nI know not whose son it is.\nIt images the forefather of God.",
        "5": "Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs;\nthe sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.\nIs not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows?\nIt is empty without being exhausted:\nThe more it works the more comes out.\nMuch speech leads inevitably to silence.\nBetter to hold fast to the void.",
        "6": "The spirit of the valley never dies.\nThis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gateway of the mysterious female\nIs called the root of heaven and earth.\nDimly visible, it seems as if it were there,\nYet use will never drain it.",
        "7": "Heaven and earth are enduring.\nThe reason why heaven and earth can be enduring is that they do not give themselves life.\nHence they are able to be long-lived.\nTherefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first,\nTreats it as extraneous to himself and it is preserved.\nIs it not because he is without thought of self that he is able to accomplish his private ends?",
        "8": "Highest good is like water.\nBecause water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way.\nIn a home it is the site that matters;\nIn quality of mind it is depth that matters;\nIn an ally it is benevolence that matters;\nIn speech it is good faith that matters;\nIn government it is order that matters;\nIn affairs it is ability that matters;\nIn action it is timeliness that matters.\nIt is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.",
        "9": "Rather than fill it to the brim by keeping it upright\nBetter to have stopped in time;\nHammer it to a point\nAnd the sharpness cannot be preserved for ever;\nThere may be gold and jade to fill a hall\nBut there is none who can keep them.\nTo be overbearing when one has wealth and position\nIs to bring calamity upon oneself.\nTo retire when the task is accomplished\nIs the way of heaven.",
        "10": "When carrying on your head your perplexed bodily soul\nCan you embrace in your arms the One and not let go?\nIn concentrating your breath can you become as supple\nAs a babe?\nCan you polish your mysterious mirror\nAnd leave no blemish?\nCan you love the people and govern the state\nWithout resorting to action?\nWhen the gates of heaven open and shut\nAre you capable of keeping to the role of the female?\nWhen your discernment penetrates the four quarters\nAre you capable of not knowing anything?\nIt gives them life and rears them.\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue.",
        "11": "Thirty spokes share one hub.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the cart.\nKnead clay in order to make a vessel.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel.\nCut out doors and windows in order to make a room.\nAdapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the room.\nThus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.",
        "12": "The five colors make man's eyes blind;\nThe five notes make his ears deaf;\nThe five tastes injure his palate;\nRiding and hunting\nMake his mind go wild with excitement;\nGoods hard to come by\nServe to hinder his progress.\nHence the sage is\nFor the belly\nNot for the eye.\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
        "13": "Favor and disgrace are things that startle;\nHigh rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble.\nWhat is meant by saying favor and disgrace are things that startle?\nFavor when it is bestowed on a subject serves to startle as much as when it is withdrawn.\nThis is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace are things that startle.\nWhat is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble?\nThe reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.\nWhen I no longer have a body, what trouble have I?\nHence he who values his body more than dominion over the empire can be entrusted with the empire.\nHe who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given the custody of the empire.",
        "14": "What cannot be seen is called evanescent;\nWhat cannot be heard is called rarefied;\nWhat cannot be touched is called minute.\nThese three cannot be fathomed\nAnd so they are confused and looked upon as one.\nIts upper part is not dazzling;\nIts lower part is not obscure.\nDimly visible, it cannot be named\nAnd returns to that which is without substance.\nThis is called the shape that has no shape,\nThe image that is without substance.\nThis is called indistinct and shadowy.\nGo up to it and you will not see its head;\nFollow behind it and you will not see its rear.\nHold fast to the way of antiquity\nIn order to keep in control the realm of today.\nThe ability to know the beginning of antiquity\nIs called the thread running through the way.",
        "15": "Of old he who was well versed in the way\nWas minutely subtle, mysteriously comprehending,\nAnd too profound to be known.\nIt is because he could not be known\nThat he can only be given a makeshift description:\nTentative, as if fording a river in winter,\nHesitant, as if in fear of his neighbors;\nFormal like a guest;\nFalling apart like the thawing ice;\nThick like the uncarved block;\nVacant like a valley;\nMurky like muddy water.\nWho can be muddy and yet, settling, slowly become limpid?\nWho can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life?\nHe who holds fast to this way\nDesires not to be full.\nIt is because he is not full\nThat he can be worn and yet newly made.",
        "16": "I do my utmost to attain emptiness;\nI hold firmly to stillness.\nThe myriad creatures all rise together\nAnd I watch their return.\nThe teaming creatures\nAll return to their separate roots.\nReturning to one's roots is known as stillness.\nThis is what is meant by returning to one's destiny.\nReturning to one's destiny is known as the constant.\nKnowledge of the constant is known as discernment.\nWoe to him who wilfully innovates\nWhile ignorant of the constant,\nBut should one act from knowledge of the constant\nOne's action will lead to impartiality,\nImpartiality to kingliness,\nKingliness to heaven,\nHeaven to the way,\nThe way to perpetuity,\nAnd to the end of one's days one will meet with no danger.",
        "17": "The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects.\nNext comes the ruler they love and praise;\nNext comes one they fear;\nNext comes one with whom they take liberties.\nWhen there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.\nHesitant, he does not utter words lightly.\nWhen his task is accomplished and his work done\nThe people all say, 'It happened to us naturally.'",
        "18": "When the great way falls into disuse\nThere are benevolence and rectitude;\nWhen cleverness emerges\nThere is great hypocrisy;\nWhen the six relations are at variance\nThere are filial children;\nWhen the state is benighted\nThere are loyal ministers.",
        "19": "Exterminate learning and there will no longer be worries.\nExterminate the sage, discard the wise,\nAnd the people will benefit a hundredfold;\nExterminate benevolence, discard rectitude,\nAnd the people will again be filial;\nExterminate ingenuity, discard profit,\nAnd there will be no more thieves and bandits.\nThese three, being false adornments, are not enough\nAnd the people must have something to which they can attach themselves:\nExhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block,\nHave little thought of self and as few desires as possible.",
        "20": "Between yea and nay\nHow much difference is there?\nBetween good and evil\nHow great is the distance?\nWhat others fear\nOne must also fear.\nThe multitude are joyous\nAs if partaking of the offering\nOr going up to a terrace in spring.\nI alone am inactive and reveal no signs,\nAnd wax without having reached the limit.\nLike a baby that has not yet learned to smile,\nListless as though with no home to go back to.\nThe multitude all have more than enough.\nI alone seem to be in want.\nMy mind is that of a fool - how blank!\nVulgar people are clear.\nI alone am drowsy.\nVulgar people are alert.\nI alone am muddled.\nCalm like the sea;\nLike a high wind that never ceases.\nThe multitude all have a purpose.\nI alone am foolish and uncouth.\nI alone am different from others\nAnd value being fed by the mother.",
        "21": "In his every movement a man of great virtue\nFollows the way and the way only.\nAs a thing the way is\nShadowy and indistinct.\nIndistinct and shadowy,\nYet within it is an image;\nShadowy and indistinct,\nYet within it is a substance.\nDim and dark,\nYet within it is an essence.\nThis essence is quite genuine\nAnd within it is something that can be tested.\nFrom the present back to antiquity,\nIts name never deserted it.\nIt serves as a means for inspecting the fathers of the multitude.\nHow do I know that the fathers of the multitude are like that?\nBy means of this.",
        "22": "Bowed down then preserved;\nBent then straight;\nHollow then full;\nWorn then new;\nA little then benefited;\nA lot then perplexed.\nTherefore the sage embraces the One and is a model for the empire.\nHe does not show himself, and so is conspicuous;\nHe does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious;\nHe does not brag, and so has merit;\nHe does not boast, and so endures.\nIt is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.\nThe way the ancients had it, 'Bowed down then preserved', is no empty saying.\nTruly it enables one to be preserved to the end.",
        "23": "To use words but rarely\nIs to be natural.\nHence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day.\nWho is it that produces these? Heaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man.\nThat is why one follows the way.\nA man of the way conforms to the way;\nA man of virtue conforms to virtue;\nA man of loss conforms to loss.\nHe who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way;\nHe who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue;\nHe who conforms to loss is gladly accepted by loss.\nWhen there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.",
        "24": "He who tiptoes cannot stand; he who strides cannot walk.\nHe who shows himself is not conspicuous;\nHe who considers himself right is not illustrious;\nHe who brags will have no merit;\nHe who boasts will not endure.\nFrom the point of view of the way these are 'excessive food and useless excresences'.\nAs there are Things that detest them, he who has the way does not abide in them.",
        "25": "There is a thing confusedly formed,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nGoes round and does not weary.\nIt is capable of being the mother of the world.\nI know not its name\nSo I style it 'the way'.\nI give it the makeshift name of 'the great'.\nBeing great, it is further described as receding,\nReceding, it is described as far away,\nBeing far away, it is described as turning back.\nHence the way is great;\nHeaven is great;\nEarth is great;\nThe king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four things that are great,\nAnd the king counts as one.\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth on heaven,\nHeaven on the way,\nAnd the way on that which is naturally so.",
        "26": "The heavy is the root of the light;\nThe still is the lord of the restless.\nTherefore the gentleman when travelling all day\nNever lets the heavily laden carts out of his sight.\nIt is only when he is safely behind walls and watch-towers\nThat he rests peacefully and is above worries.\nHow, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nMake light of his own person in the eyes of the empire?\nIf light, then the root is lost;\nIf restless, then the lord is lost.",
        "27": "One who excels in travelling leaves no wheel tracks;\nOne who excels in speech makes no slips;\nOne who excels in reckoning uses no counting rods;\nOne who excels in shutting uses no bolts yet what he has shut cannot be opened.\nOne who excels in tying uses no cords yet what he has tied cannot be undone.\nTherefore the sage always excels in saving people, and so abandons no one;\nAlways excels in saving things, and so abandons nothing.\nThis is called following one's discernment.\nHence the good man is the teacher the bad learns from;\nAnd the bad man is the material the good works on.\nNot to value the teacher\nNor to love the material\nThough it seems clever, betrays great bewilderment.\nThis is called the essential and the secret.",
        "28": "Know the male\nBut keep to the role of the female\nAnd be a ravine to the empire.\nIf you are a ravine to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not desert you\nAnd you will again return to being a babe.\nKnow the white\nBut keep to the role of the sullied\nAnd be a model to the empire.\nIf you are a model to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not be wanting\nAnd you will return to the infinite,\nKnow honour\nBut keep to the role of the disgraced\nAnd be a valley to the empire.\nIf you are a valley to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will be sufficient\nAnd you will return to being the uncarved block.\nWhen the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels.\nThe sage makes use of these and becomes the lord over the officials.\nHence the greatest cutting does not sever.",
        "29": "Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite. The empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nwhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\nHence some things lead and some follow;\nSome breathe gently and some breathe hard;\nSome are strong and some are weak;\nSome destroy and some are destroyed.\nTherefore the sage avoids excess, extravagance, and arrogance.",
        "30": "One who assists the ruler of men by means of the way does not intimidate the empire by a show of arms.\nThis is something which is liable to rebound.\nWhere troops have encamped\nThere will brambles grow;\nIn the wake of a mighty army\nBad harvests follow without fail.\nOne who is good aims only at bringing his campaign to a conclusion and dare not thereby intimidate.\nBring it to a conclusion but do not brag;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant;\nBring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not intimidate.\nA creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.\nThat which goes against the way will come to an early end.",
        "31": "It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use.\nThe gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war.\nArms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.\nWhen one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.\nThere is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men.\nOne who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire.\nOn occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;\nOn occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.\nA lieutenants place is on the left;\nThe general's place is on the right.\nThis means that it is mourning rites that are observed.\nWhen great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow.\nWhen victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.",
        "32": "The way is for ever nameless.\nThough the uncarved block is small\nNo one in the world dare claim its allegiance.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it\nThe myriad creatures will submit of their own accord,\nHeaven and earth will unite and sweet dew will fall,\nAnd the people will be equitable, though no one so decrees.\nOnly when it is cut are there names.\nAs soon as there are names\nOne ought to know that it is time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop one can be free from danger.\nThe way is to the world as the River and the Sea are to rivulets and streams.",
        "33": "He who knows others is clever;\nHe who knows himself has discernment.\nHe who overcomes others has force;\nHe who overcomes himself is strong.\nHe who knows contentment is rich;\nHe who perseveres is a man of purpose;\nHe who does not lose his station will endure;\nHe who lives out his days has had a long life.",
        "34": "The way is broad, reaching left as well as right.\nThe myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master.\nFor ever free of desire, it can be called small;\nYet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called great.\nIt is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeeds in becoming great.",
        "35": "Have in your hold the great image\nAnd the empire will come to you.\nComing to you and meeting with no harm\nIt will be safe and sound.\nMusic and food\nWill induce the wayfarer to stop.\nThe way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt cannot be heard,\nYet it cannot be exhausted by use.",
        "36": "If you would have a thing shrink,\nYou must first stretch it;\nIf you would have a thing weakened,\nYou must first strengthen it;\nIf you would have a thing laid aside,\nYou must first set it up;\nIf you would take from a thing,\nYou must first give to it.\nThis is called subtle discernment:\nThe submissive and weak will overcome the hard and strong.\nThe fish must not be allowed to leave the deep;\nThe instruments of power in a state must not be revealed to anyone.",
        "37": "The way never acts, yet nothing is left undone.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,\nThe myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord.\nAfter they are transformed, should desire raise its head,\nI shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block.\nThe nameless uncarved block\nIs but freedom from desire,\nAnd if I cease to desire and remain still,\nThe empire will be at peace of its own accord.",
        "38": "A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue.\nA man of the lowest virtue never strays from virtue and that is why he is without virtue.\nThe former never acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe latter acts but there are things left undone.\nA man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive.\nA man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive.\nA man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.\nHence when the way was lost there was virtue;\nWhen virtue was lost there was benevolence;\nWhen benevolence was lost there was rectitude;\nWhen rectitude was lost there were the rites.\nThe rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith\nAnd the beginning of disorder;\nForeknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way\nAnd the beginning of folly.\nHence the man of large mind abides in the thick not in the thin, in the fruit not in the flower.\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
        "39": "Of old, these came to be in possession of the One:\nHeaven in virtue of the One is limpid;\nEarth in virtue of the One is settled;\nGods in virtue of the One have their potencies;\nThe valley in virtue of the One is full;\nThe myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive;\nLords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire.\nIt is the One that makes these what they are.\nWithout what makes it limpid heaven might split;\nWithout what makes it settled earth might sink;\nWithout what gives them their potencies gods might spend themselves;\nWithout what makes it full the valley might run dry;\nWithout what keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish;\nWithout what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall.\nHence the superior must have the inferior as root;\nThe high must have the low as base.\nThus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'.\nThis is taking the inferior as root, is it not?\nHence the highest renown is without renown,\nNot wishing to be one among many like jade\nNor to be aloof like stone.",
        "40": "Turning back is how the way moves;\nWeakness is the means the way employs.\nThe myriad creatures in the world are born from\nSomething, and Something from Nothing.",
        "41": "When the best student hears about the way\nHe practises it assiduously;\nWhen the average student hears about the way\nIt seems to him there one moment and gone the next;\nWhen the worst student hears about the way\nHe laughs out loud.\nIf he did not laugh\nIt would be unworthy of being the way.\nHence the Chien yen has it:\nThe way that is bright seems dull;\nThe way that is forward seems to lead backward;\nThe way that is even seems rough.\nThe highest virtue is like the valley;\nThe sheerest whiteness seems sullied;\nAmple virtue seems defective;\nVigorous virtue seems indolent;\nPlain virtue seems soiled;\nThe great square has no corners.\nThe great vessel takes long to complete;\nThe great note is rarefied in sound;\nThe great image has no shape.\nThe way conceals itself in being nameless.\nIt is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.",
        "42": "The way begets one;\nOne begets two;\nTwo begets three;\nThree begets the myriad creatures.\nThe myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two.\nThere are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves.\nThus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to.\nWhat others teach I also teach.\n'The violent shall not come to a natural end.'\nI shall take this as my precept.",
        "43": "The most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the hardest in the world—that which is without substance entering that which has no crevices.\n\nThat is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action.The teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action, these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world.",
        "44": "Your name or your person,\nWhich is dearer?\nYour person or your goods,\nWhich is worth more?\nGain or loss,\nWhich is a greater bane?\nThat is why excessive meanness\nIs sure to lead to great expense;\nToo much store\nIs sure to end in immense loss.\nKnow contentment\nAnd you will suffer no disgrace;\nKnow when to stop\nAnd you will meet with no danger.\nYou can then endure.",
        "45": "Great perfection seems chipped,\nYet use will not wear it out;\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nYet use will not drain it;\nGreat straightness seems bent;\nGreat skill seems awkward;\nGreat eloquence seems tongue-tied.\nRestlessness overcomes cold;\nStillness overcomes heat.\nLimpid and still,\nOne can be a leader in the empire.",
        "46": "When the way prevails in the empire, fleet-footed horses are relegated to ploughing in the fields;\nWhen the way does not prevail in the empire, war-horses breed on the border.\nThere is no crime greater than having too many desires;\nThere is no disaster greater than not being content;\nThere is no misfortune greater than being covetous.\nHence in being content, one will always have enough.",
        "47": "Without stirring abroad\nOne can know the whole world;\nWithout looking out the window\nOne can see the way of heaven.\nThe further one goes\nThe less one knows.\nTherefore the sage knows without having to stir,\nIdentifies without having to see,\nAccomplishes without having to act.",
        "48": "In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day;\nIn the pursuit of the way one does less every day.\nOne does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one does nothing at all there is nothing that is undone.\nIt is always through not meddling that the empire is won.\nShould you meddle, then you are not equal to the task of winning the empire.",
        "49": "The sage has no mind of his own.\nHe takes as his own the mind of the people.\nThose who are good I treat as good.\nThose who are not good I also treat as good.\nIn so doing I gain in goodness.\nThose who are of good faith I have faith in.\nThose who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in.\nIn so doing I gain in good faith.\nThe sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it.\nThe people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children.",
        "50": "When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so? Because they set too much store by life.\nI have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.\nThere is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;\nThere is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;\nThere is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.\nWhy is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.",
        "51": "The way gives them life;\nVirtue rears them;\nThings give them shape;\nCircumstances bring them to maturity.\nTherefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.\nYet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\nThus the way gives them life and rears them;\nBrings them up and nurses them;\nBrings them to fruition and maturity;\nFeeds and shelters them.\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue.",
        "52": "The world had a beginning\nAnd this beginning could be the mother of the world.\nWhen you know the mother\nGo on to know the child.\nAfter you have known the child\nGo back to holding fast to the mother,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.\nBlock the openings,\nShut the doors,\nAnd all your life you will not run dry.\nUnblock the openings,\nAdd to your troubles,\nAnd to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.\nTo see the small is called discernment;\nTo hold fast to the submissive is called strength.\nUse the light\nBut give up the discernment.\nBring not misfortune upon yourself.\nThis is known as following the constant.",
        "53": "Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.\nThe great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.\nThe court is corrupt,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty;\nYet there are those dressed in fineries,\nWith swords at their sides,\nFilled with food and drink,\nAnd possessed of too much wealth.\nThis is known as taking the lead in robbery.\nFar indeed is this from the way.",
        "54": "What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out;\nWhat is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose;\nThrough this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end.\nCultivate it in your person\nAnd its virtue will be genuine;\nCultivate it in the family\nAnd its virtue will be more than sufficient;\nCultivate it in the hamlet\nAnd its virtue will endure;\nCultivate it in the state\nAnd its virtue will abound;\nCultivate it in the empire\nAnd its virtue will be pervasive.\nHence look at the person through the person;\nLook at the family through the family;\nLook at the hamlet through the hamlet;\nLook at the state through the state;\nLook at the empire through the empire.\nHow do I know that the empire is like that?\nBy means of this.",

"Cheng": {
        "1": "The tao that can be said is not the everlasting Tao.\n\nLecture: That which can be categorized and classified is not the everlasting and immutable Tao of Nature. If a name can be named, it is not the everlasting Name. \"Tao is always without a name,\" and \"tao\" is not actually the \"everlasting and immutable Name\" of heaven and earth which participated in the beginnings and growth of the myriad things. That which has no name is the origin ofheaven and earth; That which has a name is the Mother of all things. \"That which has no name\" and \"that which has a name\" are explained elsewhere in the text in this fashion: \"something is born of nothing.\" Once the world begins existing it becomes the Mother. After the Mother exists, she gives birth to the myriad things. This process of birth is elsewhere called Mysterious Female, the root of heaven and earth. In Chapter 32 it says, \"the Tao is always without a name,\" and further on in the same chapter,\"at the genesis of the world name came into being.\" All the above are continuations ofa single idea. Thus, if always without desire, one can observe indescribable marvels; If always desirous, one sees merest traces. Those two come from the same source but are differently named. Both are called Mysterious. The mystery ofthe Mysterious is the gateway to all indescribable marvels. \"Merest traces\" is a lesser path (tao). \"Merest traces\" and \"indescribable marvels\" come from the same source but with different names. Then the text says, \"both are called Mysterious,\" and finishes with, \"the gateway to all indescribable marvels.\" In clarification, \"indescribable marvels\" provide a gateway to the Tao; \"merest traces\" provide a side-path. Further on the text states,\"the door of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth,\" and, \"in opening and closing heaven's gate, can you do it without the Female?\" These references are all explanations of what is called the Mother of the myriad things. In dealing with the most important precepts of Lao-tzu, Non-action and Non-desire, what can be made of the sudden assertion, \"if always desirous, one sees merest traces?\" If taken together with the words in Chapter 64, \"the Sage desires Non-desire,\" one will begin to understand the\"desire\" of the Sage as explained, using Lao-tzu's style: the desire that can be desired is not everlasting Desire. Note: The eternal Tao and the everlasting Name are not compatible with the Tao of Man as described by Confucius: humanism and justice. What Lao-tzu calls the eternal Tao of Nature focuses specifically on Yin and Yang, soft and hard. In particular, he emphasizes that Yin conquers Yang, soft overcomes hard. His intense dislike of action as implicit in the Tao of Mankind leads to the statement \"action is false\" and therefore he champions Non-action. In another place Lao-tzu says,\"everlasting Non-desire can be called the lesser. That all things return to (the Tao) and yet (the Tao) does not act as their master can be called the greater.\" In short, the everlasting Name is just this: (the eternal Tao of Nature). The lines, \"observe the indescribable marvels ... see the merest traces. Those two come from the same source but are differently named,\" provide a gateway to the Tao; they are two (duality) and yet one (unity).",
        "2": "If everyone understands the beautiful as beauty, It is ugly. If everyone understands goodness as good, It is not good at all. ucture: Compare these lines with those elsewhere: \"the fewer who know me, the more valuable I am.\" This is the paradox of the mutual support of opposites; beauty and goodness become meaningless when everyone acknowledges them. Note: I myself hold that humanism is the most beautiful of all things, and that justice is the greatest good of all. Lao-tzu's point of view is not only contrary to this, he even says that beauty is abnormal. This, in fact and substance, takes the humanism and justice of the Confucian Tao of Mankind to be neither beautiful nor good. Is and is not are mutually arising; Difficult and easy are complementary; Long and short arise from comparison; Higher and lower are interdependent; Vocalization and verbalization harmonize with each other; Before and after accompany each other. The foregoing six phrases describing mutual functions should be taken with the words of Chapter 27; \"good people are examples for mediocre people, while mediocre people have the potential to be good people.\" This is why the Sage manages affairs of Non-action and performs wordless teaching. The myriad things are made without the slightest word. [Nature] gives birth but does not possess. It acts but does not demand subservience. It is deserving of merit, yet claims no merit. Only because it claims no credit is it indispensible. In Chapter 25 it says, \"man follows earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows Tao, Tao follows Nature.\" This is the description of \"gives birth but does not possess, acts but does not demand subservience,\" teaching to perform without waiting for words. The Yellow Emperor followed this doctrine.",
        "3": "Not honoring men of worth keeps the people from competing; Not wanting rare things keeps the people from thievery; Not paying attention to the desirable keeps the hearts of the people from disaster. ucture: These are called the benefits of Non-action. That is why the Sage governs himself by relaxing the mind, reinforcing the abdomen, gentling the will, strengthening the bones. \"Govern\" means to regulate by certain principles. \"Relaxing the mind\" (lit. making the heart vacuous) is the doctrine of Nonaction. \"Reinforcing the abdomen\" means, in the words of the Yellow Emperor: \"the Sage swallows the Breath (ch'i) of heaven to reach spiritual enlightenment.\" In Chapter 20 it says, \"prize the food of the Mother.\" 'Mother' is the mother of all living things, the life-giving 'Breath' (ch'i) of heaven-earth. This is the Tao of Lao-tzu. The will resides in the spleen (\"gentling the will\"). The bones (\"strengthening the bones\") are related to the urogenital system. The spleen is the root of post-natal life, and the urogenital system determines pre-natal life. Furthermore, the urogenital system governs one's strength. If one's will is too strong, it will not only harm one's primal energy, but will also harm the very root and trunk of one's life-span. How can one strengthen the bones? By cultivating the spermic essence (ching) and filling the bones with marrow as was taught by Ch'i-po, the teacher of the Yellow Emperor. Ch'i-po said, \"strengthening of bone and marrow is the root of life itself.\" If one were to say that the way the Sage governs himself were no more than to fill the belly with food, how could Lao-tzu's Tao Teh Ching be worthy of its title? Always cause the people to be without knowledge or desires; Cause the intelligent ones to not dare act. Let there be Non-action And there is nothing that will not be well-regulated. Chapter 65 reads,\"... not to enlighten the people, but instead gradually (make) them stupid.\" Chapter 20 says, \"What a fool's mind I have! How muddled I am!\" Lao-tzu introduces this because he desires to gradually transform the people. Translator's Note: According to the Yellow Emperor's Classic on Internal Medicine, the will resides in the spleen. The urogenital system (including the kidneys) is related to the bones. The spleen helps the stomach digest food. The urogenital system, referred to as hsien t'ien (see below) in traditional Chinese medical terminology, relates directly to the strength of one's parents. Up until the time of birth, life is totally dependent on the strength of one's parents, and so it is called hsien t'ien or 'pre-heaven, which can also be translated as 'pre-natal: According to Chinese medicine all the strength one has (eyesight, hearing, energy, taste, etc.) depends on the strength of the urogenital system. The will is inversely related to the energy of the spleen. If the will is too strong, it draws energy from the spleen. If the spleen's energy is imbalanced, it will borrow energy from the urogenital system, diminishing one's basic energy. This is based upon the Five Elements system used in traditional Chinese medicine, that is, the spleen (earth) \"overcomes\" the urogenital system (water). Ching is not just sperm or semen. It is the basic energy whereof sperm is made. The marrow of the bones is affected by the energy of this substance, according to Ch'i-po in the Yellow Emperor's Classic on Internal Medicine.",

Blunting sharp edges, resolving confusions, Diffusing glare, uniting the world: Such depth, Ah! something seems to e~ist there. I do not know whose child it is. It seems to have existed before the Ancestor. In application, Tao blends in, therefore empty and yet never filled. Chapter 45 says, \"the greatest fullness seems empty, yet its applications are never exhausted.\" Thus the \"body\" of Tao is \"so deep, Ah! it seems to be the ancestor of all things\", blunting edges and solving quandaries as if all were returned to the Oneness of Non-action. Glare is mitigated and the world united as deeply as if a great spirit were there. Whose child is it? \"It seems to have existed before the Ancestor,\" referring to Chapter 25, \"there is a chaotic thing, born before heaven and earth ... I do not know its name. I reluctantly style it 'Tao', and if forced to, reluctantly describe it 'great'.",
        "5": "Heaven and earth are not humane, treating the myriad things as straw dogs. The Sage is not humane, treating the people as straw dogs.\n\nLecture: The Tao of heaven and earth cannot be called humane. The lives of the myriad things all proceed according to nature. Their passing is no different than that of straw dogs. In ancient times, dogs fashioned from straw were used during ritual sacrifices as substitutes for the real animal. Once they had fulfilled their function, they were cast aside, thus giving rise to the observation of the text that there are no feelings of humanism involved. The Sage's actions are in accord with those of heaven and earth, not showing any favoritism toward mankind through humanism. He treats the people just as heaven and earth treat the myriad things: as if they were straw dogs. Note: Neither heaven and earth nor the Sage in any way treat humanism as desirable, and it is precisely here that Lao-tzu speaks of humanism as neither beautiful nor good. To say, as Wang Pi does, \"Earth produces straw not for the sake of feeding animals, yet animals eat it; produces dogs not for the sake of feeding man, yet men eat them,\" can be called a glib argument. But do all animals eat straw exclusively, or do men specialize in eating dogs? Wang Pi takes it so in his explanation of Lao-tzu, but is not that vastly oversimplifying the case? The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows, empty and yet inexhaustible; Move it and even more comes out. Too many words quickly exhaust; It is not as good as holding to the center. The bellows referred to is a double-acting piston bellows employed in forging metal. Here it is used figuratively to describe the space between heaven and earth. It is empty, yet never completely exhausted. The more one operates it, the more it produces air, responding ad infinitum. If man would hold to the center, following the example of heaven and earth, he would never again say too much. Too many words speedily lead to exhaustion. Chuang-tzu said: \"To maintain the center of the circle is to respond inexhaustibly.'' That is similar in meaning to this chapter.",

It lingers in wisps; Use it without haste.\n\nLecture: Valleys have a spirit called Mysterious Female. Why say the spirit does not die? This indicates that it, like Tao, is everlasting and self-perpetuating. According to the Book of Change, \"'Mysterious' refers to heaven; 'Female' refers to earth.\" The breath (ch'i) of heaven passes through the nose, hence Mysterious also refers to the nose. The breath (ch'i) of the earth passes through the mouth, and Female also refers to the mouth. The nose and mouth of humans may be likened to the root of heaven and earth. In general, all of this has to do with the application of breathing techniques and the cultivation of breath (ch 'i), as in \"it lingers in wisps; use it without haste.\" This is the gateway to the traces and marvels of Lao-tzu's Tao, and must not be disregarded. Mysterious Female can be likened to the vacuity of a valley, empty yet not empty, which is to speak of ch'i.",

Is it not because he is selfless that his Self can be realized?\n\nLecture: Because heaven and earth do not live for themselves, they can produce perpetually.

Thereby, it approaches the Tao.\n\nLecture: Low places loathed by people are capital places for water, which does not avoid sewers or cesspools, and yet which benefits everything. If good people can emulate water, they will be in the best position to approach the Tao. For one's dwelling, choose ground well. In cultivating one's mind/heart, search the deeps well. In dealing with people, treat them well. In speaking, know how to keep one's word. In governing, rectify the self well. In serving, do one's best. In acting, chose the time well.

Although one measures a crossbrace to fit, it cannot last long since the piece is small and the material weak. Wang Pi took \"crossbrace\" to mean \"sharp.\" This is unreasonable. The character for crossbrace belongs to the wood radical and thus cannot have anything to do with metal. If one's hall is filled with gold and jade, it cannot be safeguarded. If one is wealthy and honored, pride follows, and one gifts oneself with the faults thereof. When the work is done, retire; This is the Tao of heaven. If something cannot be safeguarded, then let it go; one who is proud will bring trouble upon himself. Who is capable of imitating the Tao of heaven? Who can bring flowers in the Spring and fruit in the Fall, and having done so, retire?",
        "10": "Can one unify the spirit-of-the-blood and the spirit-of-the-breath and keep them from separating?\n\nLecture: The spirits of the blood and breath are referred to in the Yellow Emperor's Classic on Internal Medicine and the Kuan-yin Tzu. In the latter it says that the nature of blood is to descend and the nature of breath (ch'i) to ascend, but when one dies this order is reversed: the spirit of the blood rises and the spirit of the breath descends. The ancients all discussed spirit-of-the-blood and spiritof-the-breath in this fashion. The text asks whether man can unify these two \"spirits\" even to the point of avoiding death. In concentrating the ch'i to attain resiliency, can one be like a baby? \"Concentrating the ch'i\" refers to breathing, which has been explained earlier. Regarding \"to attain resiliency\", Ch'i-po said, \"let the circulatory systems of blood and ch'i flow freely.\" This is the basis of Lao-tzu's emphasis on the cultivation of ch'i, as in the sayings, \"the tendons are resilient and the grip is firm\", and \"reverse old age and become like a child.\" In cleansing the Mysterious Vision can one do it flawlessly? In loving the people and governing the nation, can one cause the people to be without knowledge? In opening and closing heaven's gate, can one do it without the Female? In spreading enlightenment in all four directions, can one do it without conscious action? \"Cleansing the Mysterious Vision\" refers to Chapter 1 where it says, \"if always without desire, one can observe indescribable marvels; if always desirous, one sees merest traces.\" If it is granted that man can wash his vision, can it be done cleanly and without blemish? In loving the people and governing the nation, can one cause the people to be without cleverness and without desire? \"Female\" refers to the trigram k'un, \"earth\", and also means \"to close\". This is a reference to the Book of Change. The \"earth\" trigram looks like this===. The gate of heaven cannot always be open and never close. \"Spreading enlightenment far in all four directions\" means to hear what is commonly heard and to see what is commonly seen. Can one accomplish this without conscious action? In view of the six questions raised above, what man can harmonize with the Tao? Lao-tzu emphasizes the feminine as in, \"know the masculine, yet cleave to the feminine.\" Produce and provide a good environment; Produce but do not possess. Act but do not control. Raise but do not harvest. This is called Profound Teh. If things are done according to nature, it will not be necessary to act consciously or to insist that others rely on you. \"Profound Teh\" is that of the earth itself. Compare this with Chapter 65: \"Profound Teh is so deep, so far-reaching, it causes things to return and eventually reach Great Confluence.\" This is what is meant by Tao. 49",

Cut out doors and windows to make a room: It is the vacancy that constitutes the usefulness of the room.\n\nLecture: The empty center of the hub is where the axletree fits. Clay vessels are food containers. A room is mentioned. In each case it is the emptiness at the center that is useful. Therefore, that which is there is an advantage, But its vacancy is what is useful. In the above paragraph it says that a vehicle, a vessel, or a room all depend upon their vacancies. The usefulness is just that which is not there; that which is there is a mere advantage. According to the following chapter, the Sage concerns himself with the abdomen and not the eyes. \"Reinforcing the abdomen\" means ch'i; \"fill the valley\" also means ch'i. Hence the abdomen ought to be as empty as the valley, just as the valley is as full (reinforced) as the abdomen. If one can realize this, he can get both advantage and usefulness. If the eyes aggressively look outward, the spirit will suffer harm. If one can allow the spirit to exist unobtrusively and cultivate his breath (ch'i) as if he had no eyes, one can also add 'usefulness' to the 'advantage' of the eyes.",

Racing about on horseback and hunting cause man's mind to be maddened.\n\nLecture: All of the foregoing gives evidence that harm can be done by use of certain 'vessels' (senses). In the extreme, the result is the same as if one had lost his wits. Hard to obtain merchandise causes mankind to do wrong, So the Sage concerns himself with the abdomen and not the eyes. Therefore, he rejects the one and chooses the other. Do not prize merchandise difficult to obtain: therefore, reject the one and choose the other. The one seems substantial but in fact is hollow; the other seems hollow but in fact is real. This is the same as saying that the abdomen seemingly ought to be filled with substance, but on the contrary one should fill it with breath (ch'i); the valley seems to be empty, but in fact it is filled with vapor (ch'i). By the same token the eyes seemingly ought to be used for looking, but one should use them only to see inwardly. This is what Lao-tzu calls the Tao of the Sage. Wang Pi's interpretation says that one's belly is only for filling with food; that is also to say that one ought to pluck out one's eyes (the Sage is for the belly, not the eyes). If that were so, why does Lao-tzu say \"that which is there is an advantage; but its vacancy is what is useful?\"",

When favor is conferred upon a lowly position, it is like a shock. And when it is taken away, it is like a shock. This is what is spoken of as \"Favor and disgrace are both alarming:' What does this mean: \"Treat calamities as if they were happening to yourself\"? I am able to feel great calamities because I have a self. If I have no self, what calamity is there? Everything depends on whether one can regard himself as he would his abdomen. Is not the effect of favor conferred from those above like the effect of the five colors, the five tones, and the five flavors? If one takes himself too seriously in the end one will suffer from harm inflicted by colors, tones, and flavors, and this is greatly to be avoided. On the other hand, if one can regard himself as being as empty as his abdomen-which later becomes filled with ch'i-then one can receive the \"advantage of what is there, and the utility of its vacancy.\" In that case, what calamity could there be? In other words, \"(he) considers himself an outsider yet finds himself in the mainstream\" (See Chapter 7). Therefore, only one who values himself as he values the world is fit to be entrusted with the world. Only one who loves the world as he loves himself is worthy of being the trustee of the world. If one prizes and cherishes himself even as he does the world, then he is fit and worthy to be equally trustee of the world and his self.",

These three qualities cannot be understood no matter how much you ask about them, Yet when intermingled, they form a unity.\n\nLecture: Yi is \"to level, to eliminate\", as if one were looking at a mountain but seeing a plain. Hsi means \"small\". Wi means \"obscure, wonderful\". \"To ask\" is \"to inquire\". What does \"these three qualities cannot be understood no matter how much you ask about them\" mean? As Chapter 41 says, \"a great sound comes from a small noise. A great form has no shape. Tao is hidden and nameless....\" thus, unfathomable. \"Yet when intermingled, they form a unity,\" the unity of the Tao. Therefore, the Sage makes this unity his touchstone or structure for understanding the world. Its upper surface is not bright, its underside is not dark. In endless procession the unnameable moves on, until it returns to nothingness. It is the formless form, the image of nothingness. It may be called huang-hu. Confront it, and you cannot see its face; Follow it and you cannot see its back. Hold to the ancient Tao to regulate present realities. One who is able to comprehend the ancient beginnings may be termed a part of the system of Tao. \"not bright ... not dark\" is to say \"yet when intermingled, they form a unity.\" Formless and imageless, whether one wants to confront it or follow it, it always remains unclear. See Chapter 21, where it says, \"Evanescent and elusive it is, yet there is form contained within it. Yes, elusive and evancescent, yet there is substance to it.\" Again, \"Hold to the ancient Tao to regulate present realities.\" To comprehend this unity is \"a part of the system of Tao.\" All these phrases refer to, \"yet when intermingled, they form a unity.\"",
        "15": "In ancient times, well educated people were mysterious and in communication with heaven. Their depth was unfathomable. Precisely because they were unfathomable they appeared reluctant, even hesitant, like one wading a stream in winter;\n\nLecture: The system of the Tao can be likened to the decimal system which begins with one and ends at ten. It alternates by tens, therefore it is called a \"system.\"* Those who attained the Tao were in communication with heaven, their profundity unfathomable, and so their manner was one of reluctance: like a person who must cross a stream in winter yet is fearful he will not make it. When face to face with it, every onlooker feels reluctant about the Tao and expresses reluctance over following it. That is why \"none can carry it out.\" Wary, as if there were dangers on all four sides; Majestic in appearance; Yielding, like ice on the verge of melting; Pure in nature, like uncut jade; Broad, like a valley; Mixed, as if muddy. This describes how profound the Tao is, and how unfathoma hie. Who can still muddy water and gradually make it clear? Who can make the still gradually become alive through activity? Those who maintain the Tao do not want to be full. Just because they are not full they can avoid wearing out and being replaced. Lao-tzu comments, \"exhaust, and become renewed;' therefore, avoid old age and replacement is not necessary. See Chapter 22. Who knows that muddy water, when stilled, becomes clear; that living beings, if they seek tranquility, will extend their lifetimes? The Tao does not desire to be full, and therefore avoids the conditions necessary for replacement. As it says in Chapter 80, \"cause people to revert to using knotted ropes.\" Chapter 39 says, \"all things attained Oneness and became alive.\" Therefore I believe the second sentence of the text above must be mistaken and ought to read \"calm the active and gradually become alive.\" That is, through tranquility attain peaceful Oneness until gradually becoming alive. * Tmnslnlor's Nole: These words indicate a continuation of the discussion of \"system\" which was the subject of the previous chapter.",

To understand constancy is called enlightening. Not to understand constancy is blindly to do unfortunate things. Lrture: Utmost emptiness, profound tranquility, all things stir about-this is the enactment of Non-action. Things flourish yet in the end each returns to its root, returns to the constancy of its tranquility. \"Cycle\" is a \"return to yang,\" a phenomenon associated with the yang or active principle.* Those who do not understand constancy are blind to the truth and blunder into doing wrong. Disaster will surely follow. Understanding constancy, one gains a capacity for forbearance. If forbearing, one can be just. If just, one can administer the affairs of state morally. If one can administer the affairs of state morally, then he can communicate with heaven. To communicate with heaven is to be in accord with the Tao. If in accord with the Tao, one is everlasting, And even though his body ceases to be, he is not destroyed. \"Forbearance\" includes the capacity to be all-encompassing. \"Just\" means to be fair to all. To \"administer the affairs of state morally\" means everyone turns to the administrator for leadership. To \"communicate with heaven\" is to be in communication with all people. Heaven patterns itself after the Tao. The Tao is all-encompassing, profound, everlasting, and so without limits.

        "18": "If the great Tao is lost, Humanism and justice appear. When intelligence and cleverness arise, So does gross hypocrisy.\n\nLecture: The great Tao is described in Chapter 25 as \"the Mother of all under heaven.\" When the Mother was alive, everything in the world was her child. \"If the great Tao is lost\" all things become helpless, motherless children. When we see those who love orphans we call them humane; those who give to orphans are just. When intelligence and cleverness arise in men, like motherless children they plot to increase individual enrichment and gross hypocrisy develops. This is the basic reason why Lao-tzu opposes humanism and justice. Note: Lao-tzu says that after the great Tao is lost, humanism and justice appear. But since the great Tao has no substance, no origin, and no name, how can it be lost? If, between heaven and earth, there were no humans, then even though the great Tao were not lost, what would it matter whether it existed? If mankind were to disregard humanism and justice, it would be equivalent to heaven without the qualities of yin and yang, earth without the qualities of hardness and softness, and a return to primal chaos.* If this were the case, then why bother to return to the age of knot-tying? Tying knots is also \"intelligence and cleverness.\" If one were to speak strictly in terms of non-action, even tying knots would be too active. As for the gross hypocrisy of mankind, it is as if heaven and earth had only the qualities of yin and softness. When the qualities of yang and hardness lose the affirmative, then the qualities of yin and softness predominate. When humanism and justice are not sharp and clear, then gross hypocrisy arises. Yet Lao-tzu himself praises the use of orthodoxy (i.e. uprightness) to administer government, so even if gross hypocrisy exists there should be no great worry. When the six relationships fall into discord, Filial piety and parental affection arise. When a nation falls into darkness and confusion, Patriotic ministers arise. The \"six relationships falling into discord\" means that neither parents, children, elder brothers, younger brothers, husbands, nor wives act according to their positions. If this were the case, a minimal knowledge of the relations between parents and children would easily pass for filial piety and parental affection. If everyone behaved properly, whether as affectionate parents or as filial children, would filial piety and parental affection need names? If nations were all as well-governed as during the golden age of the T'ang and Yu Dynasties, then would such titles as patriotic ministers be necessary? Note: Lao-tzu is speaking from the reverse side of things, and he has his reasons, but I wonder what brought the six relationships into existence? How did they fall out of harmony? How could there have been a \"golden age\" of government; how did this \"golden age\" fall into darkness and confusion? To answer that everything was a product of Non-action would be overdoing it. Lao-tzu alone desires to live according to Non-action, while those who practice plain Action outnumber him a billion to one. From this it is possible to deduce that what Lao-tzu advocates cannot be carried out. * Translator's Note: Traditionally, yang and yin refer to the basic qualities of heaven, hardness and softness are the qualities of earth, and male and female are the qualities of mankind. Heaven, earth, and mankind form a trinity of \"three powers\" (or agents) (san-ts'ai) which comprise the metaphysical cosmos of traditional Chinese thought.",

Divorce humanism and abandon justice, And the people will return to filial piety and parental affection. Divorce shrewdness and abandon selfishness, And there will be no thieves.

The people should be made to adhere to these principles: \"Look to the origins and maintain purity; Diminish self and curb desires:' ucture: What is described as \"divorce wisdom ... humanism ... shrewdness; abandon intelligence ... justice ... selfishness ... and thereby benefit a hundred-fold ... return to filial piety and parental affection ... and there will be no thieves\" all points to the idea that a sage who can put his wisdom to work is Acting. Lao-tzu wants to keep the people ignorant (Chapter 65): \"The ancients who were most adept at ruling did not try to enlighten the people, but ... gradually made them stupid.\" Chapter 38 says, \"If Tao is lost, Teh appears. If Teh is lost, humanism appears. If humanism is lost, justice appears.\" Chapter 49 says, \"(the Sage's) mind merges with the world. The Sage treats everyone as his children.\" These are all descriptions of Lao-tzu's Sage. Moreover, the three sentences, \"divorce wisdom ... humanism ... shrewdness\" are the words of Lao-tzu alone, and, before him, never found clear expression. Therefore the text says, \"words are inadequate.\" Note: Dragon-like, Lao-tzu's essays and thoughts were revolutionary, easily surpassing what had gone before. However, he says, \"look to the origins and maintain purity; diminish the self and curb desires.\" That being so, then of what use are the words, \"the people will benefit a hundred-fold?\" Furthermore, if man discards humanism and justice-which Confucius says are basic tenets of the Tao of Mankind-why hope for a return to parental affection and filial piety?

What others fear, I must fear. ucture: Yea and nay indicate a comparison. Chapter 48 says, \"In pursuing knowledge, one accumulates daily; in practicing Tao, one loses daily.\" One deduces from this that by divorcing oneself from learning, not only will he have no anxieties, he ought to undergo the loss of all loss. The distance between good and bad is in Chapter 2, \"if everyone understands the beautiful as beauty, it is ugly. If everyone understands goodness as good, it is not good at all.\" The difference between good and bad is the exact opposite of what we expect. Compare the lines, \"what others fear, I must fear\" with Chapter 49, where it says, \"I am kind to the kind. I am also kind to the unkind.\" If everyone is treated with equal kindness, then what is there to fear? Wildly, endlessly, all men are merry, as though feasting upon beef or sitting on the veranda in the spring sunshine. I alone remain uncomitted, like an infant who has not yet smiled. \"Merry\" means the emotions are engaged. \"Beef\" refers to the sacrificial ox used during imperial ritual. A paraphrase of the above text would be, \"it has been going on for such a long timesigh-and they are still carrying on like this. Man's unbridled enjoyment seems as vast as an ocean-with no shore in sightyet I still remain as placid as an infant in swaddling clothes.\" I alone seem as mindless as one who has no home to return to. Everyone else has enough and more, Yet I alone seem to be left with nothing. What a fool's mind I have! How muddled I am! Most people seek brightness and clarity. I alone seek dullness and darkness. Most people are imaginative and observant. I alone am stifled and mum; I am as unmoved as the ocean, As ceaseless as the wind high in the sky. Everyone else has something to do; I alone am ignorant and dull. I alone am different from the rest in that I value taking sustenance from the Mother. \"Aimless\" means lackadaisical, listless. \"Muddled\" means to have lost everything. \"I alone am ignorant and dull. I alone differ from the rest in that I value taking sustenance from the Mother.\" \"Mother\" is the Mother of all things-that is, air or breath (ch'i)and this follows the same thread as the preceding words, \"like an infant who has not yet smiled.\" Thus it is that practicing breathing techniques is likened to sucking milk from the breast. Note: The words \"I alone am different from the rest;' and six other sentences in this chapter should be taken together with the words of Chapter 57, where it says, \"I practice Non-action ... I love tranquility ... I do not interfere in anything ... I am without desires ...\" This gives us a view of how Lao-tzu stresses ego. One who is egocentric cannot alleviate his notions of intention, necessity, and insistence. This is diametrically opposed to the views of Confucius. Herein lies a crucial difference between Laotzu and Confucius. 77",
        "21": "The countenance of a person of high moral cultivation comes from living according to the Tao. The phenomenon of Tao is so elusive and so evanescent. Evanescent and elusive it is, yet there is a form contained within it. Yes, elusive and evanescent, yet there is substance to it. So vacant and so dark, yet there is a vital essence there. This vital essence is very real. It is verifiable. From past to present its name has not been obliterated, because it is evident in the origins of all things. How do I know the circumstances of the origins of all things? Exactly by this phenomenon.\n\nLecture: The countenance of a person of high moral cultivation can only come directly from cleaving to the Tao. The Tao becomes Tao when in the midst of evanescence and elusiveness there is form and substance; when in the midst of vacancy and darkness there is an essence which is very real. Tao is verifiable, since throughout time its name has never been lost. The origins of all living creatures are evident in it, and by extension, one can know the circumstances of the phenomenon of the Tao. This Tao, although elusive, evanescent, vacant, and dark, by dint of the form and substance within it reveals the presence of an essence so real it is a verification of Tao which indicates how high one's moral cultivation is. In the eighty-one chapters of the Tao Teh Ching, there are a total of seventeen properties ascribed to Teh (sometimes rendered as \"moral cultivation,\" as in the text of this chapter) including \"primal Teh,\" \"best Teh,\" and \"everlasting Teh,\" to name a few. The more mysterious the Tao is, the more real Teh is; the more vacant Tao is, the more concrete Teh is; the more obscure Tao is, the more obvious Teh is. When Tao is cultivated in a person, his Teh is \"real;\" when cultivated in a family, its Teh has \"more influence;\" when cultivated in a village, state, or in the world, then Teh is \"lasting;' \"abundant,\" or \"universal.\" This theme is carried to the point that when Lao-tzu's Sage holds the left half of a tally-stick in comparison, those with Teh keep their half, while those without Teh forfeit theirs. This is the reason why the word k'ung, translated as \"high\" in \"high moral development,\" is vital to the text and may not be explained away as an \"empty\" (meaningless) word. Tao takes Teh as its root and trunk. If this root is made \"hollow\" or \"empty;' the Tao has no base on which to stand. If one does not allow this single word its true meaning, then the five-thousand word Tao Teh Ching will be shaken to its foundations. Note: This chapter describes what it is about the Tao that makes it the Tao. Those who sincerely desire to approach the Tao of Lao-tzu will have no place to get a hand-hold without this chapter and Chapter 14. Lao-tzu has his own Tao, attained through breathing techniques (fu ch'i chih chiao). If those who wish to cultivate their health and enrich their lives follow the principles of Non-action and No-desire and practice them seriously and with discipline, they will certainly get results. That is why the text says the Tao has form, substance, and essence so real that it is verifiable. How do I know that Lao-tzu is capable of all this? When I was young I was sick unto death, and to make a long story short, I followed Lao-tzu's method of cultivating ch'i (psycho-physiological energy consisting of an amalgram of breath, blood, and mind), enabling me to lengthen my life more than forty years. How can I ever forget the rewards Lao-tzu has given me? Nevertheless, I am a human being and as such must speak of the Tao of Mankind. My real desire, therefore, is to follow Confucius to the end. If it were otherwise, even though I lived as long as P'eng Chu (reputed to have lived to the age of 800), of what use would my life be to mankind? Although to seek a long life has its purposes, they are at a far remove from the study of the Tao of Mankind.",
        "22": "Yield, and become whole.\nBend, and become straight.\nHollow out, and become filled.\nExhaust, and become renewed.\nSmall amounts are obtainable;\nLarge amounts are confusing.\nTherefore the Sage embraces the Oneness of the Tao\nAnd becomes a guide for the whole world.\n\n---\n\nLecture: The ancient phrase has it, "yield, and become whole," which means making concessions in order to achieve a greater result in the totality of events. Lao-tzu invokes examples. The sayings "bend ... straight," "hollow ... filled," "exhaust ... renewed," and those which follow later, such as "know the masculine, cleave to the feminine," "know the bright, keep to the dull," "understand glory; keep to humility," or "sick of sickness, you will gain health," all express parallel ideas. The one who can practice the dictum, "small amounts are obtainable; large amounts are confusing ... take Oneness as a guide," penetrates to the very core and source of the Tao and will not be confused.\n\nHe does not focus on himself and so is brilliant. He does not seek self-justification and so becomes his own evidence. He does not make claims and hence is given the credit. He does not compete with anyone, and hence no one in the world can compete with him. How can that which the ancients expressed as "yield, and become whole" be meaningless? If wholly sincere, you will return to them.\n\nThe meaning of this paragraph is more or less similar to a statement in the Book of Change, "the goal of the noble man is to 'be humble in the face of adulation and thus be a shining light; be able to endure the most extreme degradation.'"\n\n---\n\nNote: When Lao-tzu introduces the quote from the Classic on Rites, "yield, and become whole," he means it in a theoretical sense. When Tseng-tzu was on the brink of death he summoned his disciples and said, "Examine my feet, examine my hands. The Book of Odes says, 'In fear and trembling as if hanging over an abyss or treading on thin ice.' From now on I know release from committing faults, my little ones!" Tseng-tzu's words* come from his personal experience in life and so are much more meaningful than the theories of Lao-tzu.\n\n* Translator's Note: Tseng-tzu (Tseng Shen, 505-c. 436 B.C.) was an outstanding disciple of Confucius and was noted for his filial piety. In this death-bed quote (see Analects 8:3), Tseng-tzu is referring to the dictum that a filial child should take care of his body so that when he meets his ancestors in the after-life he will be as whole as when he was born into the world. This is one of the goals of the noble man.",
        "23": "It is nature's way to say little,\nFor hurricanes do not last a whole morning\nnor thunderstorms all day.\nWhat causes them?\nHeaven and earth.\nIf even heaven and earth are unable to persevere for long,\nThen how much longer can man?\n\n---\n\nLecture: It is in harmony with Tao when speech is short and natural. Chapter 43 says, "few in the world attain wordless teaching and the benefit of Non-action." This is the exact opposite of "too many words quickly exhaust," in Chapter 5. Although caused by heaven and earth, hurricanes and thundershowers cannot last long, because they are too furious and violent and therefore fall outside natural laws for enduring phenomena. Lao-tzu's explanation reflects contempt for human striving.\n\nTherefore, there are those who practice the Tao.\nThose who behave according to the Tao are in communication with the Tao.\nThose who behave according to Teh are in communication with Teh.\nThose who have lost the Tao and Teh are in communication with failure.\n\nThose in communication with Tao are also joyously received by Tao.\nThose in communication with Teh are also joyously received by Teh.\nThose in communication with failure are also welcomed by failure.\nSome are not true enough to the Tao,\nAnd so there are those who are not true to it at all.\n\nThose who are in communication with the Tao are in turn welcomed by the Tao. Because of this communion, the attainment of the Tao is a joy. The same reactions hold for those who are in communication with Teh, etc. The same idea is expressed in the Book of Change: "similar tones respond to each other (sympathetic vibration); beings which have similar life-force (chi, psycho-physiological energy, breath) seek each other." The above text also says, "those in communication with failure are also welcomed by failure," which one must put beside the text of Chapter 38: "Thus, if Tao is lost, Teh appears. If Teh is lost, humanism appears. If humanism is lost, justice appears." With rumination, one will understand Lao-tzu's point: if people fail in practicing Teh, they will be happy to accept humanism. Those who have failed in following Tao, and Teh, because they do not understand them, thereby accept humanism, or failing that, justice, and are perfectly happy to do so. "Some are not true enough to the Tao, and so there are those who are not true to it at all," means that those who have failed in following either the Tao or Teh lack faith, which finally leads to complete faithlessness.",
        "24": "If one is on tiptoe, he cannot stand firm. If one stands with straddled legs he cannot walk. One who is fascinated with himself is not clear-sighted. If one seeks self-justification, he will not be his own evidence. If one makes claims, he will not get credit. If one considers his successes important, he will not endure. According to Tao, these are called \"left-over food\" and \"superfluous behavior;' and go against natural law. Hence, a man of Tao spurns them. Self-fascination, self-righteousness, self-promotion, and gloating are all products of Chapter 22. Another explanation for this section might be that a man of Tao will not travel the path of eating to excess or doing what is questionable.",
        "25": "There is a chaotic thing, born before heaven and earth, So silent, so empty, unique and unchanging, circling endlessly. It could be considered the Mother of all under heaven. I do not know its name. I reluctantly style it \"Tao;' And if forced to, reluctantly describe it as \"great:'\n\nLecture: \"Chaotic thing\" means the One, or Tao, that was born even before heaven and earth. \"Silent\" means peaceful, quiet; \"empty\" means vacant, \"unique\" means different from all else, without match. Heaven and earth might, at some time, be destroyed, but the Tao will never vanish; it is said to be changeless. \"Circling endlessly\" means circulating in all directions: north, east, south, west, up, and down, without end, becoming the mother of all creatures. Tao has no name, so the text says \"forced\" to describe it. \"Great\" can be described as going ever onward. \"Going ever onward\" can be described as going far. \"Going far\" can be described as returning. Hence, the Tao is great. Heaven is great, earth is great, and mankind, also, is great. There are four phenomena of greatness in the universe, and mankind is one of them. Mankind follows the ways of the earth, The earth follows the ways of heaven, Heaven follows the ways of Tao, And Tao follows the ways of Nature. \"Going far\" means going limitlessly. \"Returning\" means completing a circle and returning. Tao is great, equally as great as heaven and earth, and mankind is also great because it is one of the three elements of the universe (heaven, earth, and mankind). Some editions of Lao-tzu make it \"... the king, also, is great,\" which brings in Action and slants the meaning. The proper edition has it as \"mankind.\" Why does mankind \"follow the ways of the earth?\" Because the earth's Teh is fecundity. Why does earth \"follow the ways of heaven?\" Because yin and yang interact. Why does heaven \"follow the ways of Tao?\" Because the Tao melds with it to form unity. And why does Tao \"follow the ways of Nature?\" It does so, because it is part of Nature.",
        "26": "Heaviness is the root of lightness. Tranquility is the master of emotion. That is why the sage, practicing Tao all day long, does not part from his baggage. Although he may have a grand mansion, still his daily life remains simple. How can one be lord of a large state and behave lightly before the world? If light, his root will be lost; If emotional, his master will be lost.\n\nLecture: \"Lightness\" is comparable to twigs and leaves; \"heaviness\" may be likened to the roots and trunk, or basis. Emotions are like shooting stars. Tranquility is like sunlight. Baggage means the necessities of life. Even though the Sage is traveling only for a single day, he does not leave his \"baggage\" food and clothing-just as he will not abandon his roots. According to Ho-shang Kung, \"grand mansion\" means a palace. The Sage, although he has a palace to live in, nevertheless leads a life which is in no way out of the ordinary. The lord of a large state might behave lightly, thereby losing his roots, or become emotional and lose his judgment. Truly, one cannot behave lightly before the world.",
        "27": "The best walking leaves no tracks. The best speech is flawless. The best calculation needs no counting slips. The best latch has no bolt, yet cannot be opened. The best knot uses no rope, yet cannot be untied.\n\nLecture: In Chapter 8 Lao-tzu has praise for \"the best attitude is like water\" and then illustrates the principle seven times. In this chapter he mentions five examples: walking, speaking, calculating, latching, and knotting. He is describing the existence of such endless wonders as the \"enactment of Non-action\" reaching the point of producing \"nothing left undone.\" That is why the Sage is always good at saving people, and therefore abandons nobody. He is always good at saving things and therefore abandons nothing. This is called hsi ming. Hsi means \"harmonizing with\" and \"according to.\" Hsi-ming (\"harmonizing with (and according to) the attributes of things\") is an old saying. In Chapter 81 are the words, \"the way of nature benefits and does not harm.\" The Sage and heaven communicate with the same Teh, as exemplified by Emperor Yii and his system of canals and irrigation; Prince Millet and his sowing of the grains; or King Wen, who cared for the people as if their suffering were his own. Each was \"always good at saving people, and therefore abandon(ed) nobody.\" Their kindness extended even to beasts and insects, so that each was \"always good at saving things, and therefore abandon(ed) nothing.\" Theirs were acts not just according to the attributes of all creatures, but actually conforming with the way of nature. Therefore good people are examples for mediocre people, While mediocre people have the potential to be good people. Not to appreciate the example, not to cherish the potential, Is to be far astray, regardless of intelligence. This is an essential tenet of the Tao. If examples and potentials can not only fulfill their capacities but also be transformed, nothing will be bad. If, however, neither the example is appreciated nor the potential cherished, there will be confusion. Knowledge of this is essential. When Lao-tzu says do away with sagacity and reject wisdom, he is not referring to this sacred knowledge; rather, this knowledge is his name for the sacred wisdom of the Tao. 101",
        "28": "Know the masculine; cleave to the feminine. Be the valley for the world. To be the valley for the world, do not swerve from your innate nature and return to the state of infancy. Know the bright; keep to the dull. Be a guide for the world. To be a guide for the world, follow your innate nature without changing and return to the pre-conceptual. Understand glory; keep to humility. Be the valley for the world. Innate nature completed, return to original uniqueness.\n\nLecture: This section clarifies how the Tao benefits from being the lesser and delineates the ways for a person to proceed. See Chapter 32, \"Tao is to the world as a brook or valley is to the river or ocean.\" Chapter 66 says, \"that which makes the river and ocean king of the hundred valleys is the ability to benefit from being lower.\" The message is the same: cleave to the feminine, the dull, or humility, and benefit from the lesser position. To \"be the valley\" or to \"be a guide\" indicate ways for a person to proceed. Never swerve from your innate nature, thereby bringing it to fullness, and you will be able to return to the state of infancy and the pre-conceptual, or original uniqueness. Thus, in turns, Laotzu describes the Tao itself, for it is so difficult to name. When original uniqueness is divided, It then becomes the instrumentalities. The Sage employs them, They then become the officers. Thus, subtle governance shapes not. Compare the preceeding with Chapter 32, \"no matter how insignificant one's original uniqueness may be, nothing in the world can make it inferior,\" because it is a nucleus complete in itself. As soon as original uniqueness is divided and instrumentalities appear, the situation no longer includes only the Tao itself. Therefore the Sage employs the instrumentalities as officers, according to their capacities. If they return to original uniqueness, it may be likened to subtle governance that does not shape.",
        "29": "If someone strives to be the ruler of the world, I do not see how he can succeed. The world is a spiritual vessel which one cannot strive after. Those who strive after it, fail. Those who try to grasp it, lose it.\n\nLecture: Spirit has no shape, while a vessel has no spirit. Speaking of a vessel endowed with spirit stresses that the world is something that one can neither strive for nor grasp. Thus it is that creatures either lead or follow, puff strongly or softly, grow powerful or weaken, decline or fall. And therefore the Sage does away with excess, extravagance, and extremes. Ho-shang Kung's version makes it \"persevere\" instead of \"decline,\" which seems more appropriate. Chapter 64 says the Sage \"assists all things to fulfill their natures, not daring to contrive any other action.\" He proceeds according to whether leading or following, puffing strongly or softly, growing powerful or weakening, persevering or falling, only doing away with any excess, extravagance, or extreme.",
        "30": "Those who use Tao to help the ruler never use arms to force the world. Such affairs tend to reverse themselves. Nettles grow where an army camps. After a war famine is bound to follow.\n\nLecture: \"Such affairs tend to reverse themselves\" contends that one who kills will in tum be killed. Chapter 31 says, \"fine weapons are not auspicious instruments. Everything hates them. Therefore practitioners of the Tao will have nothing to do with them.\" Chapter 42 says, \"the end of a strong one is an untimely death.\" Moreover, calamity follows an army wherever it goes. Not only does a good man not do such things, he cannot even bear the sight of them. Subtly arrange the outcome and nothing more. Do not use force. After the outcome do not be complacent. After the outcome do not be smug. After the outcome do not be conceited. Overcome only because there is no other alternative. Overcome but do not force. To mature is to age, and is called contra-Tao. That which runs counter to the Tao is soon finished. \"Outcome\" means to overcome an enemy. This chapter speaks of those who use Tao to strengthen the world. After receiving the expected outcome one must not be complacent, smug, or conceited. Even when there is no choice but to go to war, do not be forceful since anything that grows strong must soon decay, just as a flint knife is easily broken. Force is against Tao, and what is against Tao will soon cease to be.",
        "31": "Fine weapons are not auspicious instruments.\nEverything hates them.\nTherefore practitioners of Tao will have nothing to do with them.\nIn everyday life the noble man regards the left side of the host as the place of honor.\nIn war the right side of the commander is the place of honor.\nSince weapons are inauspicious instruments, they are not the instruments of the noble man.\n\nHe uses them only when necessary, for peace and quiet are what he holds highest.\nTo him even a victory is not worthy of celebration.\nThose who celebrate it take pleasure in the slaughter of men.\nThose who take pleasure in the slaughter of men consequently cannot have their will with the world.\n\n---\n\nLecture: The phrase "fine weapons are not auspicious instruments" has upset quite a few commentators. Ho-shang Kung, Kuo Hsüan, and Wang Pi all used "fine" without any commentary. Later scholars made varying commentaries, replacing "fine" with "this" as being more correct, but there are several places elsewhere in the text where "this" is used. It is difficult to believe that none of those is wrong, and only this is the exception. I have suspended judgment and left it the old way.\n\nOn auspicious occasions the place of honor is to the left of the host; On inauspicious occasions the place of honor is to the right. In the military the lesser commanders stand on the left, While the commander-in-chief stands on the right, The same as in the etiquette of funerary rites. When many people have been killed there is mourning, grief, and tears. Hence, even victory is treated according to funerary rites.\n\n"On auspicious occasions . . . the left . . . on inauspicious occasions . . . the right . . ." is according to ancient ritual. Hence the ancients when they took up arms believed it to be inauspicious, and so they used the right side. They did not even consider victory a cause for celebration because they mourned the slaughtered multitudes. That is why Chapter 69 says, "when opposing troops resist each other, the one stung by grief will be the victor."",
        "32": "Tao is always without a name. Small as it may be in its original uniqueness, It is inferior to no power in the world. If a ruler can cleave to it, All beings will pay homage to him.\n\nLecture: In an earlier chapter I commented on \"Tao is always without a name.\" Because the characteristic of Tao is its purity, \"original uniqueness\" describes purity, though tiny as a pea. Therefore, \"small as it may be ... it is inferior to no power in the world,\" even the Tao. As for the line, \"if a ruler can cleave to it,\" Chapter 39 states, \"officials attained Oneness and became the orthodox of the world,\" because he cleaves to his own firm position, that of uprightness. Note: In Chapter 37, \"I will keep them in their places with the original uniqueness of the Nameless,\" expands upon the present chapter. Tao is \"always without a name,\" and here is called \"original uniqueness.\" Later on, \"without a name\" describes \"uniqueness,\" and in the opposite sense, Tao is \"everlasting Non-action.\" Scholars little versed in rules of literature have misplaced a punctuation mark, making the text read \"always nameless original uniqueness,\" which is nonsense. If one nonchalantly inserts \"nameless original uniqueness,\" then the phrase \"keep them in their places with the original uniqueness of the Nameless\" is backwards. Heaven and earth mingle in harmony and a sweet liquor rains down. Without command from above peace and order spread among the people. With the genesis of the world, names appeared. There are so many names, is it not time to stop? Knowing when to stop is to be free from danger. Tao is to the world as rivers and oceans are to brooks and valleys. The ch'i of heaven descends, the ch'i of earth rises, and their inter~ingling becomes springtime, causing a \"sweet liquor\" to fall. If a ruler can cleave to the Tao, it will spontaneously spread among the people, and his government will achieve peace. \"With the genesis of the world ...\" see Chapter 25: \"I do not know its name. I reluctantly style it 'Tao', and if forced to, reluctantly describe it as 'great',\" thereby, \"names come to be.\" \"Knowing when to stop is to he free from danger,\" and one will be durable. Therefore, the world is to the Tao as streams and valleys which return water are to rivers and oceans which receive it.",
        "33": "One who knows men is intelligent; One who knows himself has insight. One who conquers men is strong; One who conquers himself has steadfastness.\n\nLecture: Although it takes intelligence to know men, how can it compare with the insight of the man who knows himself? In other words, although the man who knows men is intelligent, he is a great fool. One who conquers men, although capable and intelligent, cannot compare to one with steadfastness who has conquered himself. Lao-tzu stresses steadfastness-or using the soft to overcome the hard-hence he says, \"directing the breath (ch'i) by heart/mind is called steadfastness.\" What a contrast to \"a strong one will come to an untimely end!\" One who knows sufficiency is rich. One who pursues his objective with steadfastness has will power. One who does not lose what he has gained is durable. One who dies yet still remains has longevity. One who knows sufficiency is not greedy. If one is not greedy, he will feel wealthy with what he has. \"One who pursues his aim with steadfastness has will power:\" certainly, how can one attain Non-action and No-desire without a firm will? \"One who dies yet still remains\" speaks of a man whose Tao has not perished even though the man himself is gone. This is longevity: \"though his body ceases to be, he is not destroyed.\"",
        "34": "The great Tao is so all pervasive, how can we tell where its right or left is? All things depend on it for growth, and it requires nothing from them. It accomplishes its work, but makes no claim for itself. It clothes and feeds all, but does not control them. Everlasting Non-desire is called \"the lesser.\" Lcture: \"All pervasive\" describes vastness and breadth. The Tao is so great that one cannot speak of left or right, up, down, or the four cardinal directions; its sphere is everywhere. Everything depends on it, but it requires nothing, neither recognition nor fealty. The same thought is expressed in chapters 10 and 51: \"produce, but do not possess; act, but do not control.\" Non-desire includes elements which might be styled \"the lesser.\" That all things return to it and yet it does not control them is called \"the greater:' Because it never insists on its greatness, Its greatness becomes a reality. The line, \"all things return to it, yet it does not control them is called 'the greater',\" refers to Non-action. The line, \"because it never insists on its greatness, its greatness becomes a reality,\" expresses the same thought as Chapter 63.",

The Tao that is uttered seems bland, even flavorless. It does not appear noteworthy. It does not sound worth listening to. It has unlimited uses. Lcture: From the beginning of this chapter up to the words, \"the passing guest pauses for sweetmeats and music,\" the language is unusual and the sentence construction extraordinary. It does not conform with Lao-tzu's claim, \"my words are very easy to understand.\" Ho-shang Kung, Wang Pi, et al., give rather forced explanations about which I am at a loss to comment. I feel it is better to suspend judgment to avoid overdoing things by \"adding legs to a snake\" (not knowing when to stop).",

That which would be overthrown must first be purposely set up. He who would take must first purposely give. This is called wei ming. Lcture: From \"that which would be shrunken\" to \"he who would take,\" the text stresses a single functional principle. v\\/ei ming, which means \"wonderfully minute and obscure, yet brilliant;' is an ancient saying similar in kind to hsi ming (see Ch. 27). Softness and suppleness overcome hardness and strength. fish cannot leave the depths. The sharpest weapons of the state cannot be displayed. Chapter 78 states, \"nothing in the world is softer and more supple than water, yet for attacking the hard and strong, nothing can match it.\" No matter how strong a fish may be, it cannot escape the ocean filled with soft, supple water. Stretching in order to shrink, giving so as to gain, weakness overcoming strength, all indicate unorthodox strategy. Just so, a nation must not display its most potent weapons.",
        "37": "Tao is always without a name, Yet there is nothing it does not do. If a ruler can cleave to it, All beings will eventually change by themselves. After this change, when they desire to act, He will keep them in their places with the original uniqueness of the Nameless. Eventually there will be Non-desire. If no desires, then serenity, And eventually the world will settle itself by itself.\n\nLecture: This chapter is the same as Chapter 32, except that, in the earlier chapter \"original uniqueness\" characterizes Tao, while in this chapter it describes the namelessness of Tao. Thus the two chapters form a unity. Some commentators have mistakenly taken the earlier chapter to read, \"Tao is forever nameless original uniqueness,\" but from this chapter the entire picure is self-evident. When all beings change and they desire to act, then the ruler uses the \"original uniqueness of the Nameless\" to curb them. Eventually there will be Non-desire. Having no desires will bring serenity, and eventually the world will also naturally settle down. Hence, \"the Tao is always without a name, yet there is nothing it does not do.\" I Part 2 Mn",
        "38": "Superior Teh does not reveal its Teh, thereby retaining it. Inferior Teh cannot rid itself of the appearance of Teh, and thereby loses it. Superior Teh practices Non-action and has no private ends to serve. Inferior Teh both acts and has private ends to serve. Superior humanism (jen) acts but has no private ends to serve. Superior justice (yi) both acts and has private ends to serve. Superior etiquette (Ii) not only acts but, getting no response, tries to enforce its will with raised fists. Thus, if Tao is lost, Teh appears. If Teh is lost, humanism appears. If humanism is lost, justice appears. If justice is lost, etiquette appears. When conscience and honesty wear thin, Etiquette is the beginning of strife.\n\nLecture: Concerning \"if Tao is lost, Teh appears,\" Tao and Teh cannot be parted, nor can yin and yang, nor can male and female. If they could be separated, what would become of nature, of the human race? Superior Teh and inferior Teh are as different as natural and unnatural. Humanism and justice naturally have a difference: the basis of justice is right and wrong. When superior etiquette acts but gets no response, it goes to the extreme of physical violence, so distant from the Tao. That is why \"when conscience and honesty wear thin, etiquette is the beginning of strife.\" As to prescience, it is merely a blossom of Tao, and the beginnings of stupidity. That is why the truly cultivated man takes generosity for his location, and does not dwell on meanness; focuses on the fruit and does not dwell on the blossom. So he avoids the one and chooses the other. Chapter 26 states, \"not daring to be first, one can lead all 'instruments',\" so Lao-tzu does not consider the foreknowledge of events a serious matter. Those who are prescient compete among themselves to be first, much as the stupid blithely undertake matters of consequence, and are the equivalent of a mere blossom of the Tao. One must treat such desires by \"keeping them in their places with the original uniqueness of the Nameless.\" One must seriously respect the fruit, take generosity for his locus, and \"not dwell on the blossom.\" One must assiduously avoid 'that' which is merely a small instrument, and cleave to 'this', into which Tao will naturally transform 'that'.",
        "39": "In times past Oneness appeared in the following pattern: The heavens attained Oneness and became clear; The earth attained Oneness and settled; The spirits attained Oneness and became numinous; Valleys attained Oneness and became reproductive; All things attained Oneness and became alive; Kings and officials attained Oneness and became the orthodox of the world.\n\nLecture: Chapter 22 says, \"the Sage embraces the Oneness of the Tao and becomes a guide for the whole world.\" Later, in Chapter 28, it says, \"to be a guide for the world, follow your innate nature without changing.\" Here, to attain Oneness is to become clear, settled, numinous, filled, reproductive, and orthodox, which all illustrates \"the Sage embraces the Oneness of the Tao.\" In the heavens, that which is not clear eventually settles. On the earth, that which does not settle dissipates. Spirits which are not numinous disappear. Valleys not filled will dry up. Creatures that do not reproduce become extinct. Kings and officials, if not honored and esteemed, will fall. \"The heavens attained Oneness and became clear\" refers to ch'i or Tao. If the heavens were not in a state of Oneness, they would not be clear, they would be turgid. That which is turgid has weight, which is not the quality of the heavens, but of the earth. Therefore, \"in the heavens, that which is not clear eventually settles.\" This is obvious. The sense of the text harmonizes with \"the Sage embraces the Oneness of Tao\" and\"... follow your innate nature without changing.\" \"(The) not numinous disappear\" and \"(the) not filled dry up\" are also in accord with this same idea. Ch'i fills the valleys. Without ch'i the valleys become arid. Hence the honorable takes the humble as its trunk. The high takes the low as its foundation. That is why officials call themselves the lonely, the hubless. This is taking the humble for the trunk, is it not? Therefore, it is better to consider the vacancy of the vehicle rather than its appearance. Do not desire to be as shiny and attractive as fine jade. Be as ordinary as stone. The Ho-shang Kung edition says, \"the analogy 'the lonely, the hubless' describes the inability to be like a hub, the center for converging spokes.\" The text continues, explaining \"therefore it is better to consider the vacancy of the vehicle rather than its appearance.\" This reference to a hub is the same as in Chapter 11: \"thirty spokes converge at a single hub: it is the vacancy that begets the vehicle's usefulness.\" Wang Pi changes 'hubless' to read 'grainless', which in this context makes no sense at all. He uses 'carriage' instead of 'vehicle', and he uses 'hardness' in place of 'ordinary'. His efforts are not as well directed as those of Hoshang Kung, who goes on to say that without a foundation or a trunk neither the high nor the honorable can succeed; that officials who are lonely cannot become 'hubs'; and that to be 'shiny and attractive' puts a premium on rarity, while the 'ordinary' is so commonplace that it is quite inexpensive and available. 137",

'Going ever onward' can be described as going far. 'Going far' can be described as returning.\" That which does not return is worn out, finished. Cyclical return gives Tao motion. The feminine principle (yin) is the focus of reference for heaven, softness is the reference point for earth, the mother and infant form the reference for mankind, water is the reference in nature.

The first chapter states, 11that which has no name is the origin of heaven and earth; that which has a name is the Mother of all things.\" Both the \"Mother\" of all things and the \"origin\" of heaven and earth result from ch'i attaining Oneness, the same way 11the heavens attained Oneness and became clear; the earth attained Oneness and settled.\" This illustrates \"unity gives birth to duality.\" When 11heaven and earth mingle in harmony and a sweet liquor rains down,\" nature reproduces and \"duality gives birth to trinity, and trinity gives birth to all things.\" Therefore, \"something is born of nothing.\"",

The old adages are similar to the saying, \"great wisdom seems like stupidity,\" which piddling scholars understand even less, precisely the reason they give contrary reactions. Great Teh seems like a valley. The completely immaculate seems disgraced. The thoroughly virtuous seems insufficient. Established morality seems a conspiracy. True characteristics seem submerged.

The completion of a great instrument definitely takes a long time. A great sound certainly is present in a tiny, tiny noise. A great form essentially has no shape. Therefore, \"Tao is hidden and nameless\" describes these sentences. And then Tao, bailing out these bankruptcies, as it were, wonderfully sees that all things are fulfilled.",

This is the \"interplay\" of yin-yang or the \"marriage\" of heaven and earth. \"And trinity gives birth to all things,\" which in turn reproduce. This is \"the ch'is of heaven and earth mingle: nature quickens,\" and \"male and female unite: nature impregnates.\" As for \"all things are wrapped by yin and contain yang,\" yin takes the external shape and yang is that contained in the middle, yet one-third of it is shaped CIZI .* \"Their pulsing ch'is marry\" is the circulating current of ch'i produced alternately by yin and yang. This is what the Book of Change calls the processes of \"transfer\" and \"transformation.\" According to these processes, all things are born of the earth, they are \"wrapped by yin,\" hence yin and softness dominate the earth. Lao-tzu borrows this viewpoint from the Book of Change, and proclaims that (ancient Chinese) rulers called themselves \"the lonely.\" Even though men dislike loneliness and believe it a \"loss\", rulers call themselves \"lonely,\" since they are cautious too much benefit will come their way. \"Thus does one either benefit from a loss or lose from a benefit.\" 145 What other people teach, I also teach. \"The end of a strong one is an untimely death.\" I will take this as a precept to teach proper behavior. This seems to say what I have taught is just like that of others. 11A strong one\" means a strong horizontal or crossing force, as when the straightness of a column is crossed by a beam. A strong cross-force overdoes the yang and the hard, and falls out of harmony with the upward thrusting ch'i. \"The stiff and hard are the moribund ones,\" describes this situation, which will result in an untimely death. According to the Shuo Wen (the earliest dictionary of Chinese, compiled in the second century, AD.), \"proper behavior means the everyday, household rules of good behavior.\" Lao-tzu is the proponent of yin and softness, the precise contrary of strength, therefore, he \"chooses the former\" and teaches proper behavior. * llll ttTI (this happens at the same time, i.e. it is mutual), giving, lffl which is represented as 1111 . 147",

This is based on reality and is not empty words. Constancy will eventually disappear without harmony; a real understanding of harmony brings constancy. Those who lose constancy also lose the requisite for wisdom, since to know constancy is enlightening. That which is harmful to life is inauspicious, just as that which is beneficial to life constitutes the auspicious. Weaklings who can mobilize ch'i by heart will inevitably become strong. Although Lao-tzu generally disapproves of the auspicious and the strong, he maintains that the ordinary person cannot become \"auspicious\" and \"strong\" as based on an infant's undissipated vital juices and unimpaired harmony. On the contrary, \"things mature and then decay. This is contra-Tao. That which runs counter to the Tao is soon finished.\" The text re-emphasizes these lines which appeared in Chapter 30. Note: \"Its bones are pliable and sinews soft\" contrasts with a line from Chapter 3: \"strengthen the bones.\" The infant is pliable and soft, because it has not yet grown. The meaning of \"strengthen the bones\" corresponds to the lines \"that which benefits life\" and \"to direct ch'i by heart is called steadfastness (strength).\" This is the proper way for the Sage to educate mankind. Mobilize the spermic essence (ching) to supplement the bone marrow and the bones are strengthened.

Too many restrictions and prohibitions interfere, and the people will become poorer and poorer.

Every person applies his own notions to Lao-tzu, thus transforming Lao-tzu into a thousand, a million different personalities, making him even more weird and mysterious. Take this chapter, for example. What need is there for an interpretation? Reluctantly, I add my own interpretation, fully realizing that it is not necessarily what Lao-tzu meant.

Moreover, the unorthodox leads to the unnatural, and the general quandary sets in. Under such circumstances, what people consider to be good fortune is completely bad.

        "68": "Good men are not aggressive. A good fighter does not lose his temper. Those skillful at overcoming an enemy never confront him directly. A skillful employer lowers himself. This is the Teh of non-contention or strength from the ability to use people. It is in accord with most ancient heaven. ucture: This chapter also repeats what Lao-tzu has said several times before. The quiescence of the female always wins over the male, hence the lower position overcomes. Tao acts through softness. \"Never confront (the enemy) directly\" means to avoid wrangling or resisting. The Gate of all Mysteries-Mysterious Female-is \"in accord with most ancient heaven.\"",
        "69": "Military tacticians have a saying: \"I dare not be the aggressor, but rather the defender; I dare not advance an inch, but would rather retreat a foot:' This is to move without moving, To raise one's fists without showing them, To lead the enemy on but against no adversary, To wield a weapon but not clash with the enemy's. No disaster is greater than taking the enemy lightly. If I take the enemy lightly, I am on the verge of losing my treasures. Hence, when opposing troops resist each other, The one stung by grief will be the victor. ucture: The text expands upon the \"three treasures\" mentioned previously, admonishing \"(be) the defender\" and \"retreat a foot,\" following the precept \"not daring to be first.\" To wield a weapon but not clash with the enemy's, to raise one's fists without showing them, and to move without moving mean that retreating is a way of advancing. To lead the enemy on without opposition is to be irresistible. Parental love, stung by grief, inspires victory. If I take the enemy lightly I am on the verge of losing my \"three treasures.\" This is Lao-tzu's unorthodox military strategy.",

My words have their sources, my deeds their precedents. If people do not understand that, they do not understand me. The fewer who know me, the more valuable I am. That is why the Sage wears coarse clothes while carrying jade in his bosom. ucture: I have explained the section beginning \"my words have their sources\" in the Lecture on Chapter 59: Lao-tzu's teaching is truly easy to understand, but his definitions and logic are so different from the common man's that they are nearly impossible to practice. \"People do not understand\" is connected with Chapter 20: \"what a fool's mind I have! ... I alone want dullness and darkness.\" Because Lao-tzu never shows knowledge favor, people do not understand him. However, he says, \"the fewer who know me, the more valuable I am.\" So the Sage \"wears coarse clothes while carrying jade in his bosom,\" and very few people know about it.",
        "71": "To know yet appear as not knowing is best. To not know yet appear as knowing is sickness. Whoever is sick of sickness will not be sick. The Sage is never sick, because he is sick of sickness. Thereby he is never sick.\n\nLecture: \"To know yet appear as not knowing is best\" harks back to Chapter 56: \"one who knows does not speak;' thereby appearing not to know. This is good. \"To not know yet appear as knowing is sickness\" describes one who does not know and yet speaks. His \"knowledge\" is his sickness, the disease of convincing oneself that he \"knows\" what he does not know. This is finally the real meaning of Lao-tzu's words, although they are very simple. \"Whoever is sick of sickness will not be sick\" means that one who recognizes this sickness as a disease will scrupulously avoid it. The Sage can do this.",
        "72": "If people do not fear the awesome, something more awful is imminent. But do not be disrespectful of their dwellings; Do not suppress their means of livelihood. If not oppressed, they will not press. That is why the Sage knows himself but does not reveal himself. He has self-respect, but does not seek recognition. Hence, he rejects one and takes the other.\n\nLecture: To have no fear of the awesome is the equivalent of trifling with the law and will inevitably result in more stringent punishments. \"But do not be disrespectful of their dwellings,\" means to police their neighborhood and avoid rudeness in the desire to make their dwellings respectable. Trifling with the law until it becomes a matter of life-and-death suppresses the people's livelihood. On the other hand, if one is not strict with himself, who else will be? That is why the Sage with his self-knowledge and self-respect is able to study the laws of nature. Although he does not make a show of himself nor seek recognition, he is able to discriminate between \"one\" and \"the other.\"",
        "73": "To have the courage to dare is to die. To have the courage to dare not is to live. Heaven abominates both these cases, whether harmful or beneficial. Who knows why? Even the Sage feels it is difficult. The Tao of heaven does not contend, yet it easily wins; It does not speak, yet gets a good response; It comes without being called; It is calm, yet everything is minutely planned. The web of heaven is so vast, so vast. Though its mesh is wide, it loses nothing.\n\nLecture: This rather complicated chapter discusses the web of heaven. It is so vast, its meshed widely spaced, yet nothing is lost, just as those who have the courage to dare not, live. As always, this is related to cleaving to the Female and harmonizing with the way of Non-action. The Tao of heaven is difficult to understand. The Sage follows it even though it is not easy. What follows next in the text, from\"... does not contend ... speak ... (nor is) called\" to \"it is calm, yet everything minutely planned,\" is simply a restatement of \"Non-action, yet there is nothing left undone.",

There is always an executioner in charge of killing. H someone tries to do the killing for the executioner, It is called trying to chop wood for the Great Carpenter. Few who substitute for the Great Carpenter do not injure their own limbs.\n\nLecture: If the people fear death, and some behave unorthodoxly and are caught and executed, who among the rest will dare oppose the social order? The remainder of the text bemoans the existence of the executioner. Not only is it inappropriate for anyone to substitute for the executioner, but it is also improper to be one.",

That is why they are unruly. If the people take death lightly, It is because they seek life's bounty. That is why they take death lightly. Those who live life without striving are exemplars of valuing life.\n\nLecture: The people starve because they are taxed too heavily. They are unruly because those above them have become selfish. The people take death lightly, because of the stress on the urgency of seeking life. Conversely, if those above practice Non-action, they allow the people to live naturally and so are worthy exemplars of valuing life.",

Hence the stiff and hard are the moribund ones; The soft and supple are the vital ones. That is why a strong army is not victorious. A hardy tree gets the axe. The hard and great are at the bottom. The soft and supple are at the top.\n\nLecture: The stiff and hard are the moribund ones; the soft and supple are the vital ones. If an army is strong it will not be victorious; if a tree is hardy it gets the axe. The stiff and hard trunk is at the bottom, while the soft and supple branches are at the top. This is according to the laws of nature.",
        "77": "The Tao of heaven is like drawing a bow: For high things, lower; for low things, raise; If excessive, reduce; if insufficent, supplement. The Tao of heaven reduces the excessive and supplements the insufficent. The way of man is not so. It takes from the insuff kent and adds to the excessive. Who can have enough surplus to supplement the world? Only those with Tao. That is why the Sage acts but does not demand subservience; Is deserving of merit yet claims no credit. He has no desire to show his worth.\n\nLecture: To draw a bow the left hand grips it and the right hand draws the string back. The left hand must be firm and unwavering. The right hand can raise or lower the arrow. If \"excessive\" or \"insufficient\" either \"reduce\" or \"supplement\" refers to tilting the bow forward or backward to bring the arrow in line with the bull's eye. The Tao of heaven reduces the excessive and supplements the insufficient, but man takes from the insufficient and adds to the excessive. Who can have enough surplus to supplement the world? Truly, only those who possess Tao. Only the Sage, in harmony with the Teh of heaven and earth, acts but does not demand subservience. He is deserving of merit yet claims no credit because he has no desire to advertise his worth.",

The soft overcomes the strong. None in the world do not know this. Yet none can practice it. That is why the Sage says to accept the filth of a nation is to be the lord of the society. To accept the disasters of a nation is to be the ruler of the world. Words of truth seem contradictory.\n\nLecture: In assaulting the hard and strong nothing is better than water, yet, though the whole world knows this, none can practice it. Hence the Sage says if one can accept even the filth and disasters of a nation, one will be lord of the society and ruler of the world. Words of truth seeming the exact opposite is similar to knowing the usefulness of the softness of water, yet not practicing it.",
        "79": "Compromising with great hatred inevitably leads to more hatred. How can this be considered good 7 That is why the Sage holds the left half of the tally-stick yet does not demand others measure up. To have Teh is to hold the other half of the tally-stick. To be without Teh is to lose the tally-stick. The Tao of heaven is not clannish. It always dwells with the good man.\n\nLecture: Hatred is related to malice; goodness is related to kindness. As kindness cannot mix with hatred, goodness cannot harmonize with badness. Compromising with hatred is not worthy of the good. The Sage, holding the tally-stick, waits for the man with Teh to take the other half. This is harmonious. The man with no Teh loses hold of the stick and slips away. The Tao of heaven is without selfish preferences. It dwells only with the virtuous (Teh) and the good.",
        "80": "In a small country of few people, even if there are hundreds of weapons, they are unnecessary. Cause the people to respect death and they will not migrate. Though there are ships and vehicles, no one boards them. Though there are armor and weapons, no one parades with them. Let men return to knotting strings and using them. Food will be sweet. Clothes will be beautiful. Homes will be comfortable. Customs will delight. Although neighboring states will see each other and hear the other's chickens and dogs, The citizens of each will age and die without establishing contact with the other.\n\nLecture: Such conditions were a dream even during Lao-tzu's time. Today, when it is possible to travel tens of thousands of miles between dawn and dusk, this eventuality is out of the question. If we wanted to return to knotting ropes, we would have to start the world from primitive beginnings again.",
        "81": "Words of truth are not beautiful; Beautiful words are not truthful. The good do not argue; Those who argue are not good. The wise are not extensively learned; The extensively learned are not wise. The Sage is not mean. Simply doing things for others he feels greater fulfillment. Simply giving to others he feels he has gained more. The Tao of heaven benefits and does not harm. The Tao of the Sage is to accomplish without competing.\n\nLecture: Herein is Lao-tzu's idea of truth, goodness, and beauty. One must be truthful to be good and be good to have beauty. Dress in coarse clothes and carry the jade in one's bosom; beauty is within. It is not something that everyone in the world can know. \"The wise are not extensively learned\" means to concentrate on the One. Doing things for others and giving himself, the Sage feels fulfillment and gain; the Sage follows the example of heaven and is not mean. Moreover, the Tao of heaven promotes birth and growth rather than harm. The Sage follows Tao, hence he accomplishes without competing. Appended Remarks on Tao and Teh Tao has three elements, which the Book of Change describes as founding heaven, founding earth, and founding mankind. Teh can no more be separated from Tao than heaven from earth, yin fron yang, or, among humans, man from woman or husband from wife. That is why the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean open with words about Tao and Teh. In simple words, that heaven aids in the creation of life is Tao; that earth aids in birth and growth is Teh. If one believes humanism and justice are sufficient to comprise Tao and Teh, one denies heaven and earth and ruins the Three Agencies (san-ts'ai: heaven, earth, and mankind). If one denies heaven and earth and yet speaks of An Inquiry On The Tao (an essay by Han Yu, 768-824 A.O.), then people must say, \"what (Han Yu) calls 'Tao' is not the true Tao; what he calls 'Teh' is not the true Teh,\" rather it would be the Tao and Teh of non-heaven and non-earth.1 How can one forget the words of Confucius in the Commentary on the Book of Change? From them I know the words of Han Yu are too simple. He did not think profoundly enough. I have nothing to say about his debunking the followers of Lao-tzu and defending the Tao of mankind. What Lao-tzu calls Tao and Teh is far from realization. Even in his own time, Lao-tzu himself knew that he could not implement his Tao, and so he left. The Han Dynasty believed in government through Non-action and held the Yellow Emperor in highest reverence, but they were unable to govern as if China were a small state with an ignorant populace. Since it is obvious that the Tao and Teh of Lao-tzu has long since become \"the private utterance of one man,\"2 what is the use of raising such a storm of protest? Mencius rebutted Yang Chu and Mo Ti because he wanted to implement humanism (jen) and justice (yi). I do not know what Han Yu wanted to implement when he rebutted Lao-tzu. \"Alas! The Tao has not been implemented for a long time.\" Those who want to implement a system, whether it be Tao and Teh or humanism and justice, must have someone with the virtues of Confucius or Mencius to lead them, or they will fail. During Confucius' lifetime he had 3,000 disciples. Those who came after took his Tao to the public, and even when their audience was ten or one hundred or even one thousand times as many, actual believers were few. However, Confucius said, \"the most wise and the most stupid do not change,\" so how could everyone belong to the school of Confucius? One may despise the unproductiveness of Buddhists and Taoists among the \"six consumers of grain,\"3 yet even if one did not follow Lao-tzu or Buddha, he would not necessarily be involved in production. Although one may diminish the effects of calamities, they are probably unavoidable. Now, to establish Tao and Teh and humanism and justice, government and education must be unified. Of what use is it to prevent people from becoming Taoist or Buddhist? The desires of people today are overflowing and morality is almost nil. If there are people who wish to follow Lao-tzu or Buddha and who have not completely lost their moral awareness, why scold them? Confucius was a man, Mencius was a man, I also am a man. Why can I not expand myself to the further reaches of mankind? If I can improve people's lives, need I despair or mourn over those who have fallen from the human level? If I did despair, even though I had Confucius and Mencius as my father and brother, what use would their teachings be? I have written this discussion of Tao and Teh to encourage people to respect the powers that be (that which supports themthe earth-and covers them-heaven) and not bring their own births to shame. If it were not for the leadership of Confucius and Mencius who showed us how to stand as human beings, what would have happened to those who came after them? If there had only been one or two people somewhere in the wide world who could shoulder the responsibility, then even though the sky shuddered, there would have been someone to hold it up. Why fear that people will not follow me? And why insist that every single person practice the Tao of Confucius and Mencius? The 2nd day of the 3rd moon, 1968 Whiskers Man Cheng of Yung-chia On sojourn in New York Translator's Notes: 1. Professor Cheng is using Han Yu's words debunking Lao-tzu to refute Han Yu's line of reasoning about Tao and Teh. 2. A quote from Han Yu's An Inquiry On The Tao (Yuan Tao): \"What (Lao-tzu) called the Way was only the Way as he understood it and not what I call the Way. What he called virtue was only the virtue as he understood it and not what I call virtue ... What Lao-tzu called the Way and virtue (Tao and Teh) was devoid of humanity and righteousness (jen and yi, the basic principles of Confucius), which was the private opinion of one man.\" A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, by Wing-tsit Chan, Princeton University Press, p. 454. 3. Again a quote from Han Yu's An Inquiry On The Tao. Han Yu argues that Taoists and Buddhists constitute one of six classes of society that consume grain (food) but the Taoists and Buddhists do not produce anything themselves. Therefore they are mere leeches on society's bounty and ought to be put to work instead of sitting in monasteries."
