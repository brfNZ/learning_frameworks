The generation process selects 7 questions with a bias toward core questions (weight 3:1 for each core question per hero). Based on a Monte Carlo simulation (100,000 runs), here's the probability distribution for the number of core questions in a set of 7

### Probability for Core questions 

| Core Qu.s | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| 0         | 0.3%        |
| 1         | 4.7%        |
| 2         | 22.3%       |
| 3         | 43.2%       |
| 4         | 29.5%       |

Most likely: 3 cores (43.2%). Expected cores per run: ~2.96.
