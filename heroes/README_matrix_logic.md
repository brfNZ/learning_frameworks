The generation process selects 7 questions with a bias toward core questions (weight 3 vs. 1 for each non-core per hero). 
Based on a Monte Carlo simulation (100,000 runs), 
here's the probability distribution for the number of core questions (non-core = 7 minus cores) in a set of 7:

#Cores  #Non-Cores  Probability
0	        7	        0.3%
1	        6	        4.7% 
2	        5	        22.3%
3	        4	        43.2%
4	        3	        29.5%

Most likely: 3 cores (43.2%). Expected cores per run: ~2.96.
