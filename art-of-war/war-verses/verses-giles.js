    "1": `Sun Tzǔ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
    
It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of
inquiry which can on no account be neglected.

The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s
deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.

These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and
discipline.

The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will
follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.

Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow
passes; the chances of life and death.

The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and
strictness.`,
