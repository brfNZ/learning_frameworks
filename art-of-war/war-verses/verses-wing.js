    "1-1": `Sun Tzu said:

Strategy is the great Work of the organization.
In Situations of life or death, it is the Tao of survival or extinction.
Its study cannot be neglected.

Therefore, Calculate a plan with Five Working Fundamentals,
And examine the condition of each.
The first is Tao.
The second is Nature.
The third is Situation.
The fourth is Leadership.
The fifth is Art.

The Tao inspires people to share in the same ideals and expectations.
Hence, because they share in life and share in death,
The people do not fear danger.

Nature is the dark or light, the cold or hot, and the Systems of time.

Situation is the distant or immediate, the obstructed or easy,
The broad or narrow, and the chances of life or death.

Leadership is intelligence, credibility, humanity, courage, and discipline.

The Art is a flexible System
Wherein the View and its officials employ the Tao.

Leaders should not be unfamiliar with these Five.
Those who understand them will triumph.
Those who do not understand them will be defeated.

___________________________________________
The word View can also be translated as "master" or "sovereign," and refers to
the mind, vision, or principle behind events.
Modem Chinese sometimes use this ideogram to refer to Jesus.`,

    "1-2": `When Calculating the Fundamentals,
Examine each one carefully.

Tell me:
Which View possesses the Tao?
Which Leader possesses competence?
Which can affect Nature and the Situation?

Which Art inspires a following?
Which Strategy has numerous strengths?
Which corps is highly trained?
Which has enlightened rewards and penalties?

It is through these that I know triumph or defeat.

If leaders who heed my Calculations are employed,
They are certain to triumph.
Retain them.

If leaders who do not heed my Calculations are employed,
They are certain to be defeated.
Remove them.

___________________________________________
The term Nature comes from the Chinese word jen, which can also be translated as "heaven."
It refers to the actions and realm of the physical laws.
The term Situation comes from the Chinese word ti, which is also translated as "earth," "region," or "place."
It refers to the terrain where the laws of nature are manifest.`,
    
    "1-3": `Heed me by Calculating the advantages
And reinforce them by Directing outwardly.

Those who Direct, follow the advantages and adjust their formula.
Those who Strategize, use the Tao of Paradox.

Thus, when able, they appear unable.
When employed, they appear useless.
When close, they appear distant.
When distant, they appear close.

They lure through advantages,
And take control through confusion.

When complete, they appear to prepare.
When forceful, they appear evasive.
When angry, they appear to submit.
When proud, they appear to be humble.
When comfortable, they appear to toil.
When attached, they appear separated.

They attack when the opponent is unprepared
And appear where least expected.

This is the Strategist's way of triumph.
It must not be discussed beforehand.`,
    
    "1-4": `Those who triumph,
Compute at their headquarters
A great number of factors
Prior to a challenge.

Those who are defeated,
Compute at their headquarters
A small number of factors
Prior to a challenge.

Much computation brings triumph.
Little computation brings defeat.
How much more so with no computation at all!

By observing only this,
I can see triumph or defeat.

___________________________________________
The term headquarters comes from the Chinese word miao, which can also be translated as
"temple"'or "imperial court," and refers to the central place of ruling.`,
    
    "2-1": `Sun Tzu said:

Generally, an Artful Strategy must be supported with
A thousand swift four-horse vehicles,
A thousand armored four-horse vehicles,
A hundred thousand armored troops,
And provisions transported for a thousand miles.

Moreover, further expenses must come from within
To be used for visitors and advisors;
Resin, varnish, and other construction materials;
And the maintenance of armor and vehicles.

To raise a corps of a hundred thousand,
A thousand pieces of gold will be spent each day.

___________________________________________
The term miles comes from the Chinese word ti, and actually refers to
a distance of about one third of a mile.

The term vehicles comes from an ideogram that is also translated as
"chariot," "wagon," or "cart."`,
