    "1-1": `Sun Tzu said:

Strategy is the great Work of the organization.
In Situations of life or death, it is the Tao of survival or extinction.
Its study cannot be neglected.

Therefore, Calculate a plan with Five Working Fundamentals,
And examine the condition of each.
The first is Tao.
The second is Nature.
The third is Situation.
The fourth is Leadership.
The fifth is Art.

The Tao inspires people to share in the same ideals and expectations.
Hence, because they share in life and share in death,
The people do not fear danger.

Nature is the dark or light, the cold or hot, and the Systems of time.

Situation is the distant or immediate, the obstructed or easy,
The broad or narrow, and the chances of life or death.

Leadership is intelligence, credibility, humanity, courage, and discipline.

The Art is a flexible System
Wherein the View and its officials employ the Tao.

Leaders should not be unfamiliar with these Five.
Those who understand them will triumph.
Those who do not understand them will be defeated.

___________________________________________
The word View can also be translated as "master" or "sovereign," and refers to
the mind, vision, or principle behind events.
Modem Chinese sometimes use this ideogram to refer to Jesus.`,
