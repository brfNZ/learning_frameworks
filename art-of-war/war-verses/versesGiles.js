    "1": `Sun Tzǔ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
    
It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of
inquiry which can on no account be neglected.

The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one’s
deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.

These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and
discipline.

The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will
follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.

Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow
passes; the chances of life and death.

The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and
strictness.`,
    
    "29": `Not doing

Those who think to win the world
by doing something to it,
I see them come to grief.
For the world is a sacred object.
Nothing is to be done to it.
To do anything to it is to damage it.
To seize it is to lose it.

Under heaven some things lead, some follow.
some blow hot, some cold.
some are strong, some weak.
some are fulfilled, some fail.

So the wise soul keeps away
from the extremes, excess, extravagance.

Lecture: For Lao Tzu, "moderation in all things" isn't just a bit of safe, practical advice. To lose the sense of the sacredness of the world is a mortal loss. To injure our world by excesses of greed and ingenuity is to endanger our own sacredness.`,
    
    "43": `Water and stone

What's softest in the world
rushes and runs
over what's hardest in the world.

The immaterial
enters
the impenetrable.

So I know the good in not doing.

The wordless teaching,
the profit in not doing-
not many people understand it.`,
