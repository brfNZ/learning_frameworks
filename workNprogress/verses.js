        "36": "In order to deplete it,\nIt must be thoroughly extended.\nIn order to weaken it,\nIt must be thoroughly strengthened.\nIn order to reject it,\nIt must be thoroughly promoted.\nIn order to take away from it,\nIt must be thoroughly endowed.\n\nThis is called a Subtle Insight.\nThe yielding can triumph over teh inflexible;\nThe weak can triumph over the strong.\nFish should not be taken from deep waters;\nNor should organizations make obvious their advantages.",
        "37": "The Tao never acts,\nAnd yet is never inactive.\n\nIf leaders can hold on to it,\nAll Things will be naturally influenced.\nInfluenced and yet desiring to act,\nI would calm them with Nameless Simplicity.\nNameless Simplicity is likewise without desire;\nAnd without desire there is harmony.\n\nThe world will then be naturally stabilized.",
        "38": "Superior Power is never Powerful, thus it has Power.\nInferior Power is always Powerful, thus it has no Power.\nSuperior Power takes no action and acts withotu motive.\nInferior Power takes action and acts with motive.\n\nSuperior philanthropy takes action and acts without motive.\nSuperior morality takes action and acts with motive.\nSuperior propriety takes action and there is no response;\nSo it raises its arm to project itself.\n\nTherefore, lose the Tao and Power follows.\nLose the Power and philanthropy follows.\nLose philanthropy and morality follows.\nLose morality and propriety follows.\n\nOne who has propriety has the veneer of truth\nAnd yet is the leader of confusion.\nOne who knows the future has the luster of the Tao\nAnd yet is ignorant of its origins.\n\nTherefore those wiht the greatest endurance\nCan enter the substantial,\nNot occupy its veneer;\nCan enter reality,\nNot occupy its luster.\nHence they discard one and receive the other.",
        "39": "From old, these may have harmony with the One:\n\nHeaven in harmony with the One becomes clear.\nEarth in harmony with the One becomes stable.\nMind in harmony with the One becomes inspired.\nValleys in harmony wiht the One become full.\nAll Things in harmony with the One becomes creawtive.\nLeaders in harmony with the One becomes incorruptible in the world.\n\nThese were attained through Oneness.\n\nHeaven without clarity would probably crack.\nEarth without stability would probably quake.\nMind without inspiration would probably sleep.\nValleys without fullness would probably dry .\nAll Things without creativity would probably die off.\nLeaders without incorruptible ways would probably stumble and fall.\n\nIndeed, the high-placed stem from teh humble;\nThe elevated are based upon the lowly.\nThis is why leaders call themselves\nAlone, lonely, and unfavored.\nIs this not because they stem form the humble and common?\nIs it not?\n\nTherefore, attain honor without being honored.\nDo not desire to shine like jade; wear ornaments as if they were stone.",

        "41": "When superior leaders hear of the Tao,\nThey diligently try to practice it.\nWhen average leaders hear of the Tao,\nThey appear both aware and unaware of it.\nWhen inferior leaders hear of the Tao,\nThey roar with laughter.\n\nWithout sufficient laughter, it could not be the Tao;\nHence the long-established sayings:\n\nThe Tao illuminated appears to be obscure;\nThe Tao advancing apperaas to be retreating;\nThe Tao leveled appears to be uneven.\n\nSuperior Power appears to be low;\nGreat clarity appears to be spotted;\nExtensive Power appears to be insufficient;\nEstablished Power appers to be stolen;\nSubstantial Power appears to be spurious.\n\nThe greatest space has no corners;\nThe greatest talents are slowly mastered;\nThe greatest music has the rarest sound;\nThe Great Image has no form.\n\nThe Tao is hidden and nameless,\nYet it is the Tao that skillfully supports and completes.",
        "42": "The Tao produced the One.\nThe One produced the Two.\nThe Two produced the Three.\nThe Three produced All Things.\n\nAll Things carry Yin and hold to Yang;\nTheir blended Influence brings Harmony.\n\nPeople hate to be alone, lonely, and unfavored;\nAnd yet leaders take these names.\n\nThus in Natural Law\nSome lose and in this way profit.\nSome profit and in this way lose.\n\nWhat others have taught, I also teach:\nThose who are violent do not die naturally.\nI will make this my chief teaching.",
        "43": "Overtake the most rigid parts of the world.\nThe insubstantial can penetrate continually.\n\nTherefore I know that wihtout action there is advantage.\n\nThis philosophy wtihout words,\nThis advantage wtihout action -\nIt is rare, in the world, to attain them.",
        "44": "Which is dearer,\nName or life?\nWhich means more,\nLife or wealth?\nWhich is worse,\nGain or loss?\n\nThe stronger the attachments,\nThe greater the cost.\nThe more that is hoarded,\nThe deeper the loss.\n\nKnow what is enough;\nBe without disgrace.\nKnow when to stop;\nBe without danger.\n\nIn this way one lasts for a very long time.",

        "47": "Without going out of doors,\nKnow the world.\nWithout looking through the window,\nSee the Tao in Nature.\nOne may travel very far,\nAnd know very little.\n\nTherefore, Evolved Individuals\nKnow without going about,\nRecognize without looking,\nAchieve without acting.",
        "48": "To pursue the academic, add to it daily.\nTo pursue the Tao, subtract from it daily.\nSubtract and subtract again,\nTo arrive at nonaction.\nThrough nonaction nothing is left undone.\n\nThe world is always held wtihout effort.\nThe moment there is effort,\nThe world is beyond holding.",
        "49": "Evolved Individuals have no fixed mind;\nThey make the mind of the People their mind.\n\nTo those who are good, I am good;\nTo those who are not good, I am also good.\nGoodness is Power.\n\nOf those who trust, I am trusting;\nOf those who do not trust, I am also trusting.\nTrust is Power.\n\nThe Evolved Individuals in the world\nAttract the world and merge with its mind.\nThe People all focus their eyes and ears;\nEvolved Individuals all act as infants.",
        "50": "As life goes out, death comes in.\n\nLife has thirteen paths;\nDeath has thirteen paths.\nHuman life arrives at the realm of death\nAlso in thirteen moves.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause life is lived lavishly.\n\nNow, as it is well known,\nThose skilled in attracting life\nCan travel across the land\nAnd not meet a rhinoceros or tiger.\nWhen the military comes in,\nTheir defence cannot be attacked.\n\nThe rhinoceros is without a place to thrust its horn.\nThe tiger is without a place to affix its claw.\nThe military is without a place to admit its blade.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they are without the realm of death.",
        "51": "The Tao produces;\nIts Power supports;\nIts Natural Law forms;\nIts influence completes.\n\nThus All Things without exception\nRespect the Tao and value its Power.\nTo respect teh Tao and value its Power -\nNo one demands this, and it comes naturally.\n\nTherefore the Tao produces and its Power supports;\nIt advances, cultivates, comforts, matures, nourishes, and protects.\n\nProduce but do not possess.\nAct without expectation.\nAdvance without dominating.\nThese are called the Subtle Powers.",
        "52": "The beginning of the world\nMay be regarded as the Mother of the world.\nTo apprehend the Mother,\nKnow the offspring.\nTo know the offspring\nIs to remain close to the Mother,\nAnd free from harm throughout life.\n\nBlock the passages,\nClose the doors;\nIn the end, life is idle.\n\nOpen the pasages,\nIncrease undertakings;\nIn the end, life is hopeless.\n\nTo perceive the small is called insight.\nTo remain yielding is called strength.\nIf, in using one's brightness,\nOne returns to insight,\nLife will be free of misfortune.\n\nThis is called learning the Absolute.",
